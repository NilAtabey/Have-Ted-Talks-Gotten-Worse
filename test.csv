travel to adulthood, two institutions oversee the journey. The first is the one we hear 
a lot about: college. Some of you may remember
the excitement that you felt when you first set off for college. Some of you may be in college right now and you're feeling this excitement
at this very moment. College has some shortcomings. It's expensive; it leaves
young people in debt. But all in all, it's a pretty good path. Young people emerge from college
with pride and with great friends and with a lot of knowledge 
about the world. And perhaps most importantly, a better chance in the labor market
than they had before they got there. Today I want to talk about
the second institution overseeing the journey from childhood
to adulthood in the United States. And that institution is prison. Young people on this journey
are meeting with probation officers instead of with teachers. They're going to court dates
instead of to class. Their junior year abroad is instead
a trip to a state correctional facility. And they're emerging from their 20s not with degrees in business and English, but with criminal records. This institution is also costing us a lot, about 40,000 dollars a year to send a young person
to prison in New Jersey. But here, taxpayers are footing the bill and what kids are getting
is a cold prison cell and a permanent mark against them
when they come home and apply for work. There are more and more kids
on this journey to adulthood than ever before in the United States
and that's because in the past 40 years, our incarceration rate 
has grown by 700 percent. I have one slide for this talk. Here it is. Here's our incarceration rate, about 716 people per 100,000
in the population. Here's the OECD countries. What's more, it's poor kids
that we're sending to prison, too many drawn from African-American
and Latino communities so that prison now stands firmly between
the young people trying to make it and the fulfillment of the American Dream. The problem's actually 
a bit worse than this 'cause we're not just sending 
poor kids to prison, we're saddling poor kids with court fees, with probation and parole restrictions, with low-level warrants, we're asking them to live 
in halfway houses and on house arrest, and we're asking them 
to negotiate a police force that is entering poor
communities of color, not for the purposes 
of promoting public safety, but to make arrest counts,
to line city coffers. This is the hidden underside to our
historic experiment in punishment: young people worried that at any moment,
they will be stopped, searched and seized. Not just in the streets, 
but in their homes, at school and at work. I got interested in this 
other path to adulthood when I was myself a college student attending the University of Pennsylvania in the early 2000s. Penn sits within a historic 
African-American neighborhood. So you've got these two parallel
journeys going on simultaneously: the kids attending 
this elite, private university, and the kids from 
the adjacent neighborhood, some of whom are making it to college, and many of whom 
are being shipped to prison. In my sophomore year, I started tutoring
a young woman who was in high school who lived about 10 minutes
away from the university. Soon, her cousin came home 
from a juvenile detention center. He was 15, a freshman in high school. I began to get to know him 
and his friends and family, and I asked him what he thought 
about me writing about his life for my senior thesis in college. This senior thesis became
a dissertation at Princeton and now a book. By the end of my sophomore year, I moved into the neighborhood
and I spent the next six years trying to understand what young people
were facing as they came of age. The first week I spent
in this neighborhood, I saw two boys, five and seven years old, play this game of chase, where the older boy
ran after the other boy. He played the cop. When the cop caught up
to the younger boy, he pushed him down, handcuffed him with imaginary handcuffs, took a quarter out of 
the other child's pocket, saying, ""I'm seizing that."" He asked the child if 
he was carrying any drugs or if he had a warrant. Many times, I saw this game repeated, sometimes children would 
simply give up running, and stick their bodies flat 
against the ground with their hands above their heads,
or flat up against a wall. Children would yell at each other, ""I'm going to lock you up, I'm going to lock you up
and you're never coming home!"" Once I saw a six-year-old child
pull another child's pants down and try to do a cavity search. In the first 18 months that I lived
in this neighborhood, I wrote down every time I saw
any contact between police and people that were my neighbors. So in the first 18 months, I watched the police stop 
pedestrians or people in cars, search people, run people's names, chase people through the streets, pull people in for questioning, or make an arrest every single day,
with five exceptions. Fifty-two times, I watched the police
break down doors, chase people through houses or make an arrest of someone
in their home. Fourteen times
in this first year and a half, I watched the police punch, choke,
kick, stomp on or beat young men after they had caught them. Bit by bit, I got to know two brothers, Chuck and Tim. Chuck was 18 when we met,
a senior in high school. He was playing on the basketball team
and making C's and B's. His younger brother, Tim, was 10. And Tim loved Chuck;
he followed him around a lot, looked to Chuck to be a mentor. They lived with their mom and grandfather in a two-story row home 
with a front lawn and a back porch. Their mom was struggling with addiction
all while the boys were growing up. She never really was able 
to hold down a job for very long. It was their grandfather's pension
that supported the family, not really enough to pay
for food and clothes and school supplies for growing boys. The family was really struggling. So when we met, Chuck was
a senior in high school. He had just turned 18. That winter, a kid in the schoolyard called Chuck's mom a crack whore. Chuck pushed the kid's face into the snow and the school cops charged him 
with aggravated assault. The other kid was fine the next day, I think it was his pride that was injured
more than anything. But anyway, since Chuck was 18, this agg. assault case sent him 
to adult county jail on State Road in northeast Philadelphia, where he sat, unable to pay the bail --
he couldn't afford it -- while the trial dates 
dragged on and on and on through almost his entire senior year. Finally, near the end of this season, the judge on this assault case
threw out most of the charges and Chuck came home with only a few hundred dollars' worth
of court fees hanging over his head. Tim was pretty happy that day. The next fall, Chuck tried 
to re-enroll as a senior, but the school secretary told him that he was then 19 and too old 
to be readmitted. Then the judge on his assault case
issued him a warrant for his arrest because he couldn't pay 
the 225 dollars in court fees that came due a few weeks after
the case ended. Then he was a high school dropout
living on the run. Tim's first arrest came later that year after he turned 11. Chuck had managed
to get his warrant lifted and he was on a payment plan
for the court fees and he was driving Tim to school
in his girlfriend's car. So a cop pulls them over, runs the car, and the car comes up 
as stolen in California. Chuck had no idea where in the history
of this car it had been stolen. His girlfriend's uncle bought it
from a used car auction in northeast Philly. Chuck and Tim had never been
outside of the tri-state, let alone to California. But anyway, the cops down at the precinct charged Chuck with 
receiving stolen property. And then a juvenile judge, 
a few days later, charged Tim, age 11, with accessory to receiving
a stolen property and then he was placed on 
three years of probation. With this probation sentence 
hanging over his head, Chuck sat his little brother down and began teaching him
how to run from the police. They would sit side by side 
on their back porch looking out into the shared alleyway and Chuck would coach Tim
how to spot undercover cars, how to negotiate a late-night police raid,
how and where to hide. I want you to imagine for a second what Chuck and Tim's lives would be like if they were living in a neighborhood
where kids were going to college, not prison. A neighborhood like the one 
I got to grow up in. Okay, you might say. But Chuck and Tim, kids like them,
they're committing crimes! Don't they deserve to be in prison? Don't they deserve to be 
living in fear of arrest? Well, my answer would be no. They don't. And certainly not for the same things 
that other young people with more privilege are doing
with impunity. If Chuck had gone to my high school, that schoolyard fight 
would have ended there, as a schoolyard fight. It never would have become
an aggravated assault case. Not a single kid that
I went to college with has a criminal record right now. Not a single one. But can you imagine how many might have
if the police had stopped those kids and searched their pockets for drugs
as they walked to class? Or had raided their frat parties
in the middle of the night? Okay, you might say. But doesn't this high incarceration rate partly account for our 
really low crime rate? Crime is down. That's a good thing. Totally, that is a good thing.
Crime is down. It dropped precipitously in
the '90s and through the 2000s. But according to a committee of academics convened by the National Academy
of Sciences last year, the relationship between our
historically high incarceration rates and our low crime rate is pretty shaky. It turns out that the crime rate
goes up and down irrespective of how many young people
we send to prison. We tend to think about justice
in a pretty narrow way: good and bad, innocent and guilty. Injustice is about being 
wrongfully convicted. So if you're convicted 
of something you did do, you should be punished for it. There are innocent and guilty people, there are victims and 
there are perpetrators. Maybe we could think a little bit
more broadly than that. Right now, we're asking kids who live
in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods, who have the least amount
of family resources, who are attending 
the country's worst schools, who are facing the toughest time
in the labor market, who are living in neighborhoods
where violence is an everyday problem, we're asking these kids to walk
the thinnest possible line -- to basically never do anything wrong. Why are we not providing support
to young kids facing these challenges? Why are we offering only handcuffs,
jail time and this fugitive existence? Can we imagine something better? Can we imagine a criminal justice system
that prioritizes recovery, prevention, civic inclusion, rather than punishment? (Applause) A criminal justice system 
that acknowledges the legacy of exclusion that poor people
of color in the U.S. have faced and that does not promote
and perpetuate those exclusions. (Applause) And finally, a criminal justice system
that believes in black young people, rather than treating black young people 
as the enemy to be rounded up. (Applause) The good news is that we already are. A few years ago, Michelle Alexander
wrote ""The New Jim Crow,"" which got Americans to see 
incarceration as a civil rights issue of historic proportions in a way
they had not seen it before. President Obama and Attorney General 
Eric Holder have come out very strongly on sentencing reform, on the need to address 
racial disparity in incarceration. We're seeing states throw out
Stop and Frisk as the civil rights violation that it is. We're seeing cities and states
decriminalize possession of marijuana. New York, New Jersey
and California have been dropping their 
prison populations, closing prisons, while also seeing a big drop in crime. Texas has gotten into the game now, also closing prisons, 
investing in education. This curious coalition is building 
from the right and the left, made up of former prisoners
and fiscal conservatives, of civil rights activists
and libertarians, of young people taking to the streets
to protest police violence against unarmed black teenagers, and older, wealthier people -- some of you are here in the audience -- pumping big money into 
decarceration initiatives In a deeply divided Congress, the work of reforming 
our criminal justice system is just about the only thing
that the right and the left are coming together on. I did not think I would see
this political moment in my lifetime. I think many of the people
who have been working tirelessly to write about the causes and consequences of our historically 
high incarceration rates did not think we would see
this moment in our lifetime. The question for us now is,
how much can we make of it? How much can we change? I want to end with a call to young people, the young people attending college and the young people
struggling to stay out of prison or to make it through prison
and return home. It may seem like these paths
to adulthood are worlds apart, but the young people participating
in these two institutions conveying us to adulthood, they have one thing in common: Both can be leaders in the work
of reforming our criminal justice system. Young people have always been leaders
in the fight for equal rights, the fight for more people 
to be granted dignity and a fighting chance at freedom. The mission for the generation 
of young people coming of age in this, a sea-change
moment, potentially, is to end mass incarceration and 
build a new criminal justice system, emphasis on the word justice. Thanks. (Applause)"

-3y6_7_5PcQ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3y6_7_5PcQ,Why are drug prices so high? Investigating the outdated US patent system | Priti Krishtel,Why are drug prices so high? Investigating the outdated US patent system,Priti Krishtel,12:35,755,93550,2020-02-06,"For my husband,
it was love at first sight. (Laughter) Here's what happened. Years ago, Rudy, who I had strictly put
in the friend zone at the time, came over to my house and met my dad, a pharmaceutical scientist
who had just retired after bringing a drug to market. My dad said, ""Ah, you probably
wouldn't have heard of it. It's for IPF, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis."" Rudy paused for a long time,
and then he said, ""That's the disease that took
my father's life 15 years ago."" Rudy says that this
is the moment he fell in love. (Laughter) With my father. (Laughter) Even though it was too late
for my dad to save his, he felt that destiny had delivered us
this full-circle moment. In my family, we have a special love
for my father's inventions. And in particular, we have
a reverence for his patents. We have framed patents
on the wall in our house. And there's a recognition in our family
that everything I've been able to do -- college, law school,
health justice work -- all of it is because America
enabled my father to fulfill his potential as an inventor. (Applause) Last year, I met the director
of the US Patent Office for the first time, and I sent my family a selfie
from that office in Virginia. (Laughter) I got so many emojis back, you would have thought I had met Beyoncé. (Laughter) But truth be told, I was actually there
to talk about a problem -- how our outdated patent system
is fueling the high cost of medicines and costing lives. Today, over two billion people
live without access to medicines. And against this global crisis, drug prices are skyrocketing, including in wealthier countries. Thirty-four million Americans
have lost a family member or a friend in the last five years, not because the treatment didn't exist, but because they couldn't afford it. Rising drug costs are pushing
families into homelessness, seniors into bankruptcy and parents to crowdfunding treatment
for their critically ill children. There are many reasons for this crisis, but one is the outdated patent system that America tries to export
to the rest of the world. The original intention
behind the patent system was to motivate people to invent by rewarding them
with a time-limited monopoly. But today, that intention
has been distorted beyond recognition. Corporations have teams
of lawyers and lobbyists whose sole job is to extend
patent protection as long as possible. And they've kept the patent office busy. It took 155 years for the US Patent Office to issue its first five million patents. It took just 27 years
for it to issue the next five million. We haven't gotten
drastically more inventive. Corporations have gotten
drastically better at gaming the system. Drug patents have exploded -- between 2006 and 2016, they doubled. But consider this: The vast majority of medicines
associated with new drug patents are not new. Nearly eight out of 10
are for existing ones, like insulin or aspirin. My organization,
a team of lawyers and scientists, recently conducted an investigation
into the 12 best-selling drugs in America. We found that, on average, there are 125 patents
filed on each medicine. Often for things we've known
how to do for decades, like putting two pills into one. The higher a patent wall a company builds, the longer they hold on to their monopoly. And with no one to compete with, they can set prices at whim. And because these are medicines and not designer watches, we have no choice but to pay. The patent wall is a strategy
to block competition. Not for the 14 years maximum that America's founders
originally envisioned, or the 20 years allowed by law today, but for 40 years or more. Meanwhile, prices on these drugs
have continued to increase -- 68 percent since 2012. That's seven times the rate of inflation. And people are struggling or even dying, because they can't afford the meds. Now I want to be really clear
about something. This isn't about making
the pharmaceutical industry the bad guy. What I'm talking about today is whether the system we created
to promote progress is actually working as intended. Sure, the pharmaceutical companies
are gaming the system, but they're gaming it because they can. Because we have failed
to adapt this system to meet today's realities. The government is handing out one of the most prized
rewards in business -- the opportunity to create a product
that is protected from competition -- and asking for less and less
in return on our behalf. Imagine awarding 100 Pulitzer Prizes
to one author for the same book. (Murmurs) It doesn't have to be this way. We can create a modern patent system to meet the needs
of a 21st-century society. And to do that, we need to reimagine the patent system
to serve the public, not just corporations. So how do we do it? Five reforms. First, we need to stop
handing out so many patents. Back under the Kennedy administration, in an effort to curb rising drug costs, a congressman from Tennessee
proposed an idea. He said, ""If you want to tweak a drug, and you want to get another patent on it, the modified version has to be
significantly better, therapeutically, for patients."" Because of intense lobbying, this idea never saw the light of day. But a reimagined patent system would resurrect and evolve
this simple, yet elegant proposition. That to get a patent, you have to invent something
substantially better than what's already out there. This shouldn't be controversial. As a society, we reserve the big rewards
for the big ideas. We don't give Michelin stars
to chefs who just tweak a recipe -- we give them to chefs who change
how we think about food. And yet, we hand out patents
worth billions of dollars for minor changes. It's time to raise the bar. Second, we need to change the financial incentives
of the Patent Office. Right now, the revenue
of the Patent Office is directly linked to the number
of patents that it grants. That's like private prisons
getting paid more to hold more people -- it naturally leads to more incarceration, not less. The same is true for patents. Third, we need more public participation. Right now, the patent system
is like a black box. It's a two-way conversation
between the patent office and industry. You and I aren't invited to that party. But imagine if instead, the Patent Office became a dynamic center
for citizen learning and ingenuity, staffed not just by technical
experts and bureaucrats, but also by great
public-health storytellers with a passion for science. Regular citizens could get
accessible information about complex technologies like artificial intelligence
or gene editing, enabling us to participate
in the policy conversations that directly impact our health and lives. Fourth, we need to get the right to go to court. Right now in America,
after a patent is granted, the public has no legal standing. Only those with a commercial interest,
usually other drug companies, have that right. But I've witnessed firsthand
how lives can be saved when everyday citizens
have the right to go to court. Back in 2006 in India, my organization worked
with patient advocates to challenge, legally,
unjust HIV drug patents, at a time when so many people were dying, because medicines
were priced out of reach. We were able to bring down
the prices of medicines by up to 87 percent. (Applause) On just three drugs, we were able to save health systems
half a billion dollars. Now, cases like these
can save millions of lives and billions of dollars. Imagine if Americans
had the right to go to court, too. And lastly, we need stronger oversight. We need an independent unit
that can serve as a public advocate, regularly monitoring the activities
of the Patent Office and reporting to Congress. If a unit like this had existed, it would have caught, for example,
the Silicon Valley company Theranos before it got so many patents
for blood testing and landed an evaluation
of nine billion dollars, when in reality, there was no invention there at all. This kind of accountability
is going to become increasingly urgent. In the age of 23andMe, important questions are being asked about whether companies
can patent and sell our genetic information
and our patient data. We need to be part of those conversations before it's too late. Our information is being used
to create the new therapies. And when that moment of diagnosis
comes for me and my family, or for you and yours, are we going to have to crowdfund
to save the lives of those we love? That's not the world I want to live in. It's not the world I want
for my two-year-old son. My dad is growing older now, and he is still as quietly brilliant
and morally directed as ever. Sometimes people ask us
whether things get heated between us: the patent-holding scientist and his patent-reforming lawyer daughter. It's such a profound misunderstanding
of what's at stake, because this is not
about scientists versus activists, or invention versus protection. This is about people, our quest to invent and our right to live. My dad and I understand
that our ingenuity and our dignity go hand in hand. We are on the same side. It is time to reimagine a patent system that reflects that knowing. Thank you. (Applause)"

Reviewer: Krystian Aparta So, on April 23 of 2013, the Associated Press
put out the following tweet on Twitter. It said, ""Breaking news: Two explosions at the White House and Barack Obama has been injured."" This tweet was retweeted 4,000 times
in less than five minutes, and it went viral thereafter. Now, this tweet wasn't real news
put out by the Associated Press. In fact it was false news, or fake news, that was propagated by Syrian hackers that had infiltrated
the Associated Press Twitter handle. Their purpose was to disrupt society,
but they disrupted much more. Because automated trading algorithms immediately seized
on the sentiment on this tweet, and began trading based on the potential that the president of the United States
had been injured or killed in this explosion. And as they started tweeting, they immediately sent
the stock market crashing, wiping out 140 billion dollars
in equity value in a single day. Robert Mueller, special counsel
prosecutor in the United States, issued indictments
against three Russian companies and 13 Russian individuals on a conspiracy to defraud
the United States by meddling in the 2016
presidential election. And what this indictment tells as a story is the story of the Internet
Research Agency, the shadowy arm of the Kremlin
on social media. During the presidential election alone, the Internet Agency's efforts reached 126 million people
on Facebook in the United States, issued three million individual tweets and 43 hours' worth of YouTube content. All of which was fake -- misinformation designed to sow discord
in the US presidential election. A recent study by Oxford University showed that in the recent
Swedish elections, one third of all of the information
spreading on social media about the election was fake or misinformation. In addition, these types
of social-media misinformation campaigns can spread what has been called
""genocidal propaganda,"" for instance against
the Rohingya in Burma, triggering mob killings in India. We studied fake news and began studying it
before it was a popular term. And we recently published
the largest-ever longitudinal study of the spread of fake news online on the cover of ""Science""
in March of this year. We studied all of the verified
true and false news stories that ever spread on Twitter, from its inception in 2006 to 2017. And when we studied this information, we studied verified news stories that were verified by six
independent fact-checking organizations. So we knew which stories were true and which stories were false. We can measure their diffusion, the speed of their diffusion, the depth and breadth of their diffusion, how many people become entangled
in this information cascade and so on. And what we did in this paper was we compared the spread of true news
to the spread of false news. And here's what we found. We found that false news
diffused further, faster, deeper and more broadly than the truth in every category of information
that we studied, sometimes by an order of magnitude. And in fact, false political news
was the most viral. It diffused further, faster,
deeper and more broadly than any other type of false news. When we saw this, we were at once worried but also curious. Why? Why does false news travel
so much further, faster, deeper and more broadly than the truth? The first hypothesis
that we came up with was, ""Well, maybe people who spread false news
have more followers or follow more people, or tweet more often, or maybe they're more often 'verified'
users of Twitter, with more credibility, or maybe they've been on Twitter longer."" So we checked each one of these in turn. And what we found
was exactly the opposite. False-news spreaders had fewer followers, followed fewer people, were less active, less often ""verified"" and had been on Twitter
for a shorter period of time. And yet, false news was 70 percent more likely
to be retweeted than the truth, controlling for all of these
and many other factors. So we had to come up
with other explanations. And we devised what we called
a ""novelty hypothesis."" So if you read the literature, it is well known that human attention
is drawn to novelty, things that are new in the environment. And if you read the sociology literature, you know that we like to share
novel information. It makes us seem like we have access
to inside information, and we gain in status
by spreading this kind of information. So what we did was we measured the novelty
of an incoming true or false tweet, compared to the corpus
of what that individual had seen in the 60 days prior on Twitter. But that wasn't enough,
because we thought to ourselves, ""Well, maybe false news is more novel
in an information-theoretic sense, but maybe people
don't perceive it as more novel."" So to understand people's
perceptions of false news, we looked at the information
and the sentiment contained in the replies
to true and false tweets. And what we found was that across a bunch
of different measures of sentiment -- surprise, disgust, fear, sadness, anticipation, joy and trust -- false news exhibited significantly more
surprise and disgust in the replies to false tweets. And true news exhibited
significantly more anticipation, joy and trust in reply to true tweets. The surprise corroborates
our novelty hypothesis. This is new and surprising,
and so we're more likely to share it. At the same time,
there was congressional testimony in front of both houses of Congress
in the United States, looking at the role of bots
in the spread of misinformation. So we looked at this too -- we used multiple sophisticated
bot-detection algorithms to find the bots in our data
and to pull them out. So we pulled them out,
we put them back in and we compared what happens
to our measurement. And what we found was that, yes indeed, bots were accelerating
the spread of false news online, but they were accelerating
the spread of true news at approximately the same rate. Which means bots are not responsible for the differential diffusion
of truth and falsity online. We can't abdicate that responsibility, because we, humans,
are responsible for that spread. Now, everything
that I have told you so far, unfortunately for all of us, is the good news. The reason is because
it's about to get a whole lot worse. And two specific technologies
are going to make it worse. We are going to see the rise
of a tremendous wave of synthetic media. Fake video, fake audio
that is very convincing to the human eye. And this will powered by two technologies. The first of these is known
as ""generative adversarial networks."" This is a machine-learning model
with two networks: a discriminator, whose job it is to determine
whether something is true or false, and a generator, whose job it is to generate
synthetic media. So the synthetic generator
generates synthetic video or audio, and the discriminator tries to tell,
""Is this real or is this fake?"" And in fact, it is the job
of the generator to maximize the likelihood
that it will fool the discriminator into thinking the synthetic
video and audio that it is creating is actually true. Imagine a machine in a hyperloop, trying to get better
and better at fooling us. This, combined with the second technology, which is essentially the democratization
of artificial intelligence to the people, the ability for anyone, without any background
in artificial intelligence or machine learning, to deploy these kinds of algorithms
to generate synthetic media makes it ultimately so much easier
to create videos. The White House issued
a false, doctored video of a journalist interacting with an intern
who was trying to take his microphone. They removed frames from this video in order to make his actions
seem more punchy. And when videographers
and stuntmen and women were interviewed
about this type of technique, they said, ""Yes, we use this
in the movies all the time to make our punches and kicks
look more choppy and more aggressive."" They then put out this video and partly used it as justification to revoke Jim Acosta,
the reporter's, press pass from the White House. And CNN had to sue
to have that press pass reinstated. There are about five different paths
that I can think of that we can follow to try and address some
of these very difficult problems today. Each one of them has promise, but each one of them
has its own challenges. The first one is labeling. Think about it this way: when you go to the grocery store
to buy food to consume, it's extensively labeled. You know how many calories it has, how much fat it contains -- and yet when we consume information,
we have no labels whatsoever. What is contained in this information? Is the source credible? Where is this information gathered from? We have none of that information when we are consuming information. That is a potential avenue,
but it comes with its challenges. For instance, who gets to decide,
in society, what's true and what's false? Is it the governments? Is it Facebook? Is it an independent
consortium of fact-checkers? And who's checking the fact-checkers? Another potential avenue is incentives. We know that during
the US presidential election there was a wave of misinformation
that came from Macedonia that didn't have any political motive but instead had an economic motive. And this economic motive existed, because false news travels
so much farther, faster and more deeply than the truth, and you can earn advertising dollars
as you garner eyeballs and attention with this type of information. But if we can depress the spread
of this information, perhaps it would reduce
the economic incentive to produce it at all in the first place. Third, we can think about regulation, and certainly, we should think
about this option. In the United States, currently, we are exploring what might happen
if Facebook and others are regulated. While we should consider things
like regulating political speech, labeling the fact
that it's political speech, making sure foreign actors
can't fund political speech, it also has its own dangers. For instance, Malaysia just instituted
a six-year prison sentence for anyone found spreading misinformation. And in authoritarian regimes, these kinds of policies can be used
to suppress minority opinions and to continue to extend repression. The fourth possible option
is transparency. We want to know
how do Facebook's algorithms work. How does the data
combine with the algorithms to produce the outcomes that we see? We want them to open the kimono and show us exactly the inner workings
of how Facebook is working. And if we want to know
social media's effect on society, we need scientists, researchers and others to have access
to this kind of information. But at the same time, we are asking Facebook
to lock everything down, to keep all of the data secure. So, Facebook and the other
social media platforms are facing what I call
a transparency paradox. We are asking them, at the same time, to be open and transparent
and, simultaneously secure. This is a very difficult needle to thread, but they will need to thread this needle if we are to achieve the promise
of social technologies while avoiding their peril. The final thing that we could think about
is algorithms and machine learning. Technology devised to root out
and understand fake news, how it spreads, and to try and dampen its flow. Humans have to be in the loop
of this technology, because we can never escape that underlying any technological
solution or approach is a fundamental ethical
and philosophical question about how do we define truth and falsity, to whom do we give the power
to define truth and falsity and which opinions are legitimate, which type of speech
should be allowed and so on. Technology is not a solution for that. Ethics and philosophy
is a solution for that. Nearly every theory
of human decision making, human cooperation and human coordination has some sense of the truth at its core. But with the rise of fake news, the rise of fake video, the rise of fake audio, we are teetering on the brink
of the end of reality, where we cannot tell
what is real from what is fake. And that's potentially
incredibly dangerous. We have to be vigilant
in defending the truth against misinformation. With our technologies, with our policies and, perhaps most importantly, with our own individual responsibilities, decisions, behaviors and actions. Thank you very much. (Applause)"

And I say believe because this process is still ongoing. Right now there are major expeditions being planned for next year that I'll talk a little bit about. One of the things that's changed here, in the last 150 years since Jules Verne had great science-fiction concepts of what the underworld was like, is that technology has enabled us to go to these places that were previously completely unknown and speculated about. We can now descend thousands of meters into the Earth with relative impunity. Along the way we've discovered fantastic abysses and chambers so large that you can see for hundreds of meters without a break in the line of sight. When you go on a thing like this, we can usually be in the field for anywhere from two to four months, with a team as small as 20 or 30, to as big as 150. And a lot of people ask me, you know, what kind of people do you get for a project like this? While our selection process is not as rigorous as NASA, it's nonetheless thorough. We're looking for competence, discipline, endurance, and strength. In case you're wondering, this is our strength test. (Laughter) But we also value esprit de corps and the ability to diplomatically resolve inter-personal conflict while under great stress in remote locations. We have already gone far beyond the limits of human endurance. From the entrance, this is nothing like a commercial cave. You're looking at Camp Two in a place called J2, not K2, but J2. We're roughly two days from the entrance at that point. And it's kind of like a high altitude mountaineering trip in reverse, except that you're now running a string of these things down. The idea is to try to provide some measure of physical comfort while you're down there, otherwise in damp, moist, cold conditions in utterly dark places. I should mention that everything you're seeing here, by the way, is artificially illuminated at great effort. Otherwise it is completely dark in these places. The deeper you go, the more you run into a conflict with water. It's basically like a tree collecting water coming down. And eventually you get to places where it is formidable and dangerous and unfortunately slides just don't do justice. So I've got a very brief clip here that was taken in the late 1980s. So descend into Huautla Plateau in Mexico. (Video) Now I have to tell you that the techniques being shown here are obsolete and dangerous. We would not do this today unless we were doing it for film. (Laughter) Along that same line, I have to tell you that with the spate of Hollywood movies that came out last year, we have never seen monsters underground -- at least the kind that eat you. If there is a monster underground, it is the crushing psychological remoteness that begins to hit every member of the team once you cross about three days inbound from the nearest entrance. Next year I'll be leading an international team to J2. We're going to be shooting from minus 2,600 meters -- that's a little over 8,600 feet down -- at 30 kilometers from the entrance. The lead crews will be underground for pushing 30 days straight. I don't think there's been a mission like that in a long time. Eventually, if you keep going down in these things, probability says that you're going to run into a place like this. It's a place where there's a fold in the geologic stratum that collects water and fills to the roof. And when you used to find these things, they would put a label on a map that said terminal siphon. Now I remember that term really well for two reasons. Number one, it's the name of my rock band, and second, is because the confrontation of these things forced me to become an inventor. And we've since gone on to develop many generations of gadgets for exploring places like this. This is some life-support equipment closed-cycle. And you can use that now to go for many kilometers horizontally underwater and to depths of 200 meters straight down underwater. When you do this kind of stuff it's like doing EVA. It's like doing extra-vehicular activity in space, but at much greater distances, and at much greater physical peril. So it makes you think about how to design your equipment for long range, away from a safe haven. Here's a clip from a National Geographic movie that came out in 1999. (Video) Narrator: Exploration is a physical process of putting your foot in places where humans have never stepped before. This is where the last little nugget of totally unknown territory remains on this planet. To experience it is a privilege. Bill Stone: That was taken in Wakulla Springs, Florida. Couple of things to note about that movie. Every piece of equipment that you saw in there did not exist before 1999. It was developed within a two-year period and used on actual exploratory projects. This gadget you see right here was called the digital wall mapper, and it produced the first three-dimensional map anybody has ever done of a cave, and it happened to be underwater in Wakulla Springs. It was that gadget that serendipitously opened a door to another unexplored world. This is Europa. Carolyn Porco mentioned another one called Enceladus the other day. This is one of the places where planetary scientists believe there is a highest probability of the detection of the first life off earth in the ocean that exists below there. For those who have never seen this story, Jim Cameron produced a really wonderful IMAX movie couple of years ago, called ""Aliens of the Deep."" There was a brief clip -- (Video) Narrator: A mission to explore under the ice of Europa would be the ultimate robotic challenge. Europa is so far away that even at the speed of light, it would take more than an hour for the command just to reach the vehicle. It has to be smart enough to avoid terrain hazards and to find a good landing site on the ice. Now we have to get through the ice. You need a melt probe. It's basically a nuclear-heated torpedo. The ice could be anywhere from three to 16 miles deep. Week after week, the melt probe will sink of its own weight through the ancient ice, until finally -- Now, what are you going to do when you reach the surface of that ocean? You need an AUV, an autonomous underwater vehicle. It needs to be one smart puppy, able to navigate and make decisions on its own in an alien ocean. BS: What Jim didn't know when he released that movie was that six months earlier NASA had funded a team I assembled to develop a prototype for the Europa AUV. I mean, I cut through three years of engineering meetings, design and system integration, and introduced DEPTHX -- Deep Phreatic Thermal Explorer. And as the movie says, this is one smart puppy. It's got 96 sensors, 36 onboard computers, 100,000 lines of behavioral autonomy code, packs more than 10 kilos of TNT in electrical onboard equivalent. This is the target site, the world's deepest hydrothermal spring at Cenote Zacaton in northern Mexico. It's been explored to a depth of 292 meters and beyond that nobody knows anything. This is part of DEPTHX's mission. There are two primary targets we're doing here. One is, how do you do science autonomy underground? How do you take a robot and turn it into a field microbiologist? There are more stages involved here than I've got time to tell you about, but basically we drive through the space, we populate it with environmental variables -- sulphide, halide, things like that. We calculate gradient surfaces, and drive the bot over to a wall where there's a high probability of life. We move along the wall, in what's called proximity operations, looking for changes in color. If we see something that looks interesting, we pull it into a microscope. If it passes the microscopic test, we go for a collection. We either draw in a liquid sample, or we can actually take a solid core from the wall. No hands at the wheel. This is all behavioral autonomy here that's being conducted by the robot on its own. The real hat trick for this vehicle, though, is a disruptive new navigation system we've developed, known as 3D SLAM, for simultaneous localization and mapping. DEPTHX is an all-seeing eyeball. Its sensor beams look both forward and backward at the same time, allowing it to do new exploration while it's still achieving geometric sensor-lock on what it's gone through already. What I'm going to show you next is the first fully autonomous robotic exploration underground that's ever been done. This May, we're going to go from minus 1,000 meters in Zacaton, and if we're very lucky, DEPTHX will bring back the first robotically-discovered division of bacteria. The next step after that is to test it in Antartica and then, if the funding continues and NASA has the resolution to go, we could potentially launch by 2016, and by 2019 we may have the first evidence of life off this planet. What then of manned space exploration? The government recently announced plans to return to the moon by 2024. The successful conclusion of that mission will result in infrequent visitation of the moon by a small number of government scientists and pilots. It will leave us no further along in the general expansion of humanity into space than we were 50 years ago. Something fundamental has to change if we are to see common access to space in our lifetime. What I'm going to show you next are a couple of controversial ideas. And I hope you'll bear with me and have some faith that there's credibility behind what we're going to say here. There are three underpinnings of working in space privately. One of them is the requirement for economical earth-to-space transport. The Bert Rutans and Richard Bransons of this world have got this in their sights and I salute them. Go, go, go. The next thing we need are places to stay on orbit. Orbital hotels to start with, but workshops for the rest of us later on. The final missing piece, the real paradigm-buster, is this: a gas station on orbit. It's not going to look like that. If it existed, it would change all future spacecraft design and space mission planning. Now, to give you a chance to understand why there is power in that statement, I've got to give you the basics of Space 101. And the first thing is everything you do in space you pay by the kilogram. Anybody drink one of these here this week? You'd pay 10,000 dollars for that in orbit. That's more than you pay for TED, if Google dropped their sponsorship. (Laughter) The second is more than 90 percent of the weight of a vehicle is in propellant. Thus, every time you'd want to do anything in space, you are literally blowing away enormous sums of money every time you hit the accelerator. Not even the guys at Tesla can fight that physics. So, what if you could get your gas at a 10th the price? There is a place where you can. In fact, you can get it better -- you can get it at 14 times lower if you can find propellant on the moon. There is a little-known mission that was launched by the Pentagon, 13 years ago now, called Clementine. And the most amazing thing that came out of that mission was a strong hydrogen signature at Shackleton crater on the south pole of the moon. That signal was so strong, it could only have been produced by 10 trillion tons of water buried in the sediment, collected over millions and billions of years by the impact of asteroids and comet material. If we're going to get that, and make that gas station possible, we have to figure out ways to move large volumes of payload through space. We can't do that right now. The way you normally build a system right now is you have a tube stack that has to be launched from the ground, and resist all kinds of aerodynamic forces. We have to beat that. We can do it because in space there are no aerodynamics. We can go and use inflatable systems for almost everything. This is an idea that, again, came out of Livermore back in 1989, with Dr. Lowell Wood's group. And we can extend that now to just about everything. Bob Bigelow currently has a test article in the orbit. We can go much further. We can build space tugs, orbiting platforms for holding cryogens and water. There's another thing. When you're coming back from the moon, you have to deal with orbital mechanics. It says you're moving 10,000 feet per second faster than you really want to be to get back to your gas station. You got two choices. You can burn rocket fuel to get there, or you can do something really incredible. You can dive into the stratosphere, and precisely dissipate that velocity, and come back out to the space station. It has never been done. It's risky and it's going to be one hell of a ride -- better than Disney. The traditional approach to space exploration has been that you carry all the fuel you need to get everybody back in case of an emergency. If you try to do that for the moon, you're going to burn a billion dollars in fuel alone sending a crew out there. But if you send a mining team there, without the return propellant, first -- (Laughter) Did any of you guys hear the story of Cortez? This is not like that. I'm much more like Scotty. I like this equipment, you know, and I really value it so we're not going to burn the gear. But, if you were truly bold you could get it there, manufacture it, and it would be the most dramatic demonstration that you could do something worthwhile off this planet that has ever been done. There's a myth that you can't do anything in space for less than a trillion dollars and 20 years. That's not true. In seven years, we could pull off an industrial mission to Shackleton and demonstrate that you could provide commercial reality out of this in low-earth orbit. We're living in one of the most exciting times in history. We're at a magical confluence where private wealth and imagination are driving the demand for access to space. The orbital refueling stations I've just described could create an entirely new industry and provide the final key for opening space to the general exploration. To bust the paradigm a radically different approach is needed. We can do it by jump-starting with an industrial Lewis and Clark expedition to Shackleton crater, to mine the moon for resources, and demonstrate they can form the basis for a profitable business on orbit. Talk about space always seems to be hung on ambiguities of purpose and timing. I would like to close here by putting a stake in the sand at TED. I intend to lead that expedition. (Applause) It can be done in seven years with the right backing. Those who join me in making it happen will become a part of history and join other bold individuals from time past who, had they been here today, would have heartily approved. There was once a time when people did bold things to open the frontier. We have collectively forgotten that lesson. Now we're at a time when boldness is required to move forward. 100 years after Sir Ernest Shackleton wrote these words, I intend to plant an industrial flag on the moon and complete the final piece that will open the space frontier, in our time, for all of us. Thank you. (Applause)"
-BvcToPZCLI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BvcToPZCLI,The most important thing you can do to fight climate change: talk about it | Katharine Hayhoe,The most important thing you can do to fight climate change: talk about it,Katharine Hayhoe,17:12,1032,216416,2019-01-11,"Reviewer: Camille Martínez It was my first year
as an atmospheric science professor at Texas Tech University. We had just moved to Lubbock, Texas, which had recently been named
the second most conservative city in the entire United States. A colleague asked me to guest teach
his undergraduate geology class. I said, ""Sure."" But when I showed up,
the lecture hall was cavernous and dark. As I tracked the history
of the carbon cycle through geologic time to present day, most of the students were slumped over,
dozing or looking at their phones. I ended my talk with a hopeful request
for any questions. And one hand shot up right away. I looked encouraging, he stood up,
and in a loud voice, he said, ""You're a democrat, aren't you?"" (Laughter) ""No,"" I said, ""I'm Canadian."" (Laughter) (Applause) That was my baptism by fire into what has now become a sad
fact of life here in the United States and increasingly across Canada as well. The fact that the number one predictor of whether we agree
that climate is changing, humans are responsible and the impacts are increasingly
serious and even dangerous, has nothing to do with how much we know
about science or even how smart we are but simply where we fall
on the political spectrum. Does the thermometer give us
a different answer depending on if we're liberal
or conservative? Of course not. But if that thermometer tells us
that the planet is warming, that humans are responsible and that to fix this thing, we have to wean ourselves off
fossil fuels as soon as possible -- well, some people would rather
cut off their arm than give the government
any further excuse to disrupt their comfortable lives
and tell them what to do. But saying, ""Yes, it's a real problem,
but I don't want to fix it,"" that makes us the bad guy,
and nobody wants to be the bad guy. So instead, we use arguments like,
""It's just a natural cycle."" ""It's the sun."" Or my favorite, ""Those climate scientists
are just in it for the money."" (Laughter) I get that at least once a week. But these are just
sciencey-sounding smoke screens, that are designed to hide
the real reason for our objections, which have nothing to do with the science and everything to do
with our ideology and our identity. So when we turn on the TV these days, it seems like pundit X is saying, ""It's cold outside.
Where is global warming now?"" And politician Y is saying, ""For every scientist
who says this thing is real, I can find one who says it isn't."" So it's no surprise that sometimes we feel
like everybody is saying these myths. But when we look at the data -- and the Yale Program
on Climate [Change] Communication has done public opinion polling across
the country now for a number of years -- the data shows that actually 70 percent
of people in the United States agree that the climate is changing. And 70 percent also agree
that it will harm plants and animals, and it will harm future generations. But then when we dig down a bit deeper,
the rubber starts to hit the road. Only about 60 percent of people think it
will affect people in the United States. Only 40 percent of people
think it will affect us personally. And then when you ask people,
""Do you ever talk about this?"" two-thirds of people in the entire
United States say, ""Never."" And even worse, when you say,
""Do you hear the media talk about this?"" Over three-quarters of people say no. So it's a vicious cycle. The planet warms. Heat waves get stronger. Heavy precipitation gets more frequent. Hurricanes get more intense. Scientists release yet another
doom-filled report. Politicians push back even more strongly, repeating the same
sciencey-sounding myths. What can we do to break
this vicious cycle? The number one thing we can do
is the exact thing that we're not doing: talk about it. But you might say, ""I'm not a scientist. How am I supposed to talk
about radiative forcing or cloud parametrization
in climate models?"" We don't need to be talking
about more science; we've been talking about the science
for over 150 years. Did you know that it's been
150 years or more since the 1850s, when climate scientists first discovered that digging up and burning
coal and gas and oil is producing heat-trapping gases that is wrapping an extra blanket
around the planet? That's how long we've known. It's been 50 years since scientists
first formally warned a US president of the dangers of a changing climate, and that president was Lyndon B. Johnson. And what's more,
the social science has taught us that if people have built their identity
on rejecting a certain set of facts, then arguing over those facts
is a personal attack. It causes them to dig in deeper, and it digs a trench,
rather than building a bridge. So if we aren't supposed to talk
about more science, or if we don't need to talk
about more science, then what should we be talking about? The most important thing to do is, instead of starting up with your head,
with all the data and facts in our head, to start from the heart, to start by talking about
why it matters to us, to begin with genuinely shared values. Are we both parents? Do we live in the same community? Do we enjoy the same outdoor activities:
hiking, biking, fishing, even hunting? Do we care about the economy
or national security? For me, one of the most foundational ways
I found to connect with people is through my faith. As a Christian, I believe that God created
this incredible planet that we live on and gave us responsibility
over every living thing on it. And I furthermore believe
that we are to care for and love the least fortunate among us, those who are already suffering
the impacts of poverty, hunger, disease and more. If you don't know what
the values are that someone has, have a conversation, get to know them,
figure out what makes them tick. And then once we have, all we have to do is connect the dots
between the values they already have and why they would care
about a changing climate. I truly believe, after thousands
of conversations that I've had over the past decade and more, that just about every single
person in the world already has the values they need
to care about a changing climate. They just haven't connected the dots. And that's what we can do
through our conversation with them. The only reason why I care
about a changing climate is because of who I already am. I'm a mother, so I care
about the future of my child. I live in West Texas,
where water is already scarce, and climate change is impacting
the availability of that water. I'm a Christian, I care
about a changing climate because it is, as the military calls it,
a ""threat multiplier."" It takes those issues, like poverty and hunger and disease
and lack of access to clean water and even political crises
that lead to refugee crises -- it takes all of these issues
and it exacerbates them, it makes them worse. I'm not a Rotarian. But when I gave my first talk
at a Rotary Club, I walked in and they had this giant banner
that had the Four-Way Test on it. Is it the truth? Absolutely. Is it fair? Heck, no, that's why I care
most about climate change, because it is absolutely unfair. Those who have contributed
the least to the problem are bearing the brunt of the impacts. It went on to ask: Would it be beneficial to all,
would it build goodwill? Well, to fix it certainly would. So I took my talk, and I reorganized it
into the Four-Way Test, and then I gave it to this group
of conservative businesspeople in West Texas. (Laughter) And I will never forget at the end, a local bank owner came up to me
with the most bemused look on his face. And he said, ""You know, I wasn't sure
about this whole global warming thing, but it passed the Four-Way Test."" (Laughter) (Applause) These values, though --
they have to be genuine. I was giving a talk at a Christian college
a number of years ago, and after my talk, a fellow scientist
came up and he said, ""I need some help. I've been really trying hard
to get my foot in the door with our local churches, but I can't seem to get any traction. I want to talk to them
about why climate change matters."" So I said, ""Well, the best thing to do is to start with the denomination
that you're part of, because you share the most values
with those people. What type of church do you attend?"" ""Oh, I don't attend any church,
I'm an atheist,"" he said. (Laughter) I said, ""Well, in that case,
starting with a faith community is probably not the best idea. Let's talk about what you do enjoy doing,
what you are involved in."" And we were able to identify
a community group that he was part of,
that he could start with. The bottom line is, we don't have to be
a liberal tree hugger to care about a changing climate. All we have to be is a human
living on this planet. Because no matter where we live, climate change is already
affecting us today. If we live along the coasts, in many places, we're already seeing
""sunny-day flooding."" If we live in western North America, we're seeing much greater area
being burned by wildfires. If we live in many coastal locations, from the Gulf of Mexico
to the South Pacific, we are seeing stronger hurricanes,
typhoons and cyclones, powered by a warming ocean. If we live in Texas
or if we live in Syria, we're seeing climate change
supersize our droughts, making them more frequent and more severe. Wherever we live, we're already
being affected by a changing climate. So you might say, ""OK, that's good.
We can talk impacts. We can scare the pants off people,
because this thing is serious."" And it is, believe me.
I'm a scientist, I know. (Laughter) But fear is not
what is going to motivate us for the long-term, sustained change
that we need to fix this thing. Fear is designed to help us
run away from the bear. Or just run faster
than the person beside us. (Laughter) What we need to fix this thing
is rational hope. Yes, we absolutely do need
to recognize what's at stake. Of course we do. But we need a vision of a better future -- a future with abundant energy, with a stable economy, with resources available to all, where our lives are not worse
but better than they are today. There are solutions. And that's why the second important
thing that we have to talk about is solutions -- practical, viable,
accessible, attractive solutions. Like what? Well, there's no
silver bullet, as they say, but there's plenty of silver buckshot. (Laughter) There's simple solutions
that save us money and reduce our carbon footprint
at the same time. Yes, light bulbs. I love my plug-in car. I'd like some solar shingles. But imagine if every home
came with a switch beside the front door, that when you left the house, you could
turn off everything except your fridge. And maybe the DVR. (Laughter) Lifestyle choices: eating local,
eating lower down the food chain and reducing food waste,
which at the global scale, is one of the most important things
that we can do to fix this problem. I'm a climate scientist, so the irony of traveling around
to talk to people about a changing climate is not lost on me. (Laughter) The biggest part of my personal
carbon footprint is my travel. And that's why I carefully
collect my invitations. I usually don't go anywhere
unless I have a critical mass of invitations in one place -- anywhere from three to four to sometimes even as many as
10 or 15 talks in a given place -- so I can minimize the impact
of my carbon footprint as much as possible. And I've transitioned nearly
three-quarters of the talks I give to video. Often, people will say,
""Well, we've never done that before."" But I say, ""Well, let's give it a try,
I think it could work."" Most of all, though, we need to talk about what's already
happening today around the world and what could happen in the future. Now, I live in Texas, and Texas has the highest carbon emissions
of any state in the United States. You might say, ""Well,
what can you talk about in Texas?"" The answer is: a lot. Did you know that in Texas
there's over 25,000 jobs in the wind energy industry? We are almost up to 20 percent
of our electricity from clean, renewable sources,
most of that wind, though solar is growing quickly. The largest army base
in the United States, Fort Hood, is, of course, in Texas. And they've been powered
by wind and solar energy now, because it's saving taxpayers
over 150 million dollars. Yes. (Applause) What about those who don't have
the resources that we have? In sub-Saharan Africa,
there are hundreds of millions of people who don't have access to any type
of energy except kerosine, and it's very expensive. Around the entire world, the fastest-growing type
of new energy today is solar. And they have plenty of solar. So social impact investors,
nonprofits, even corporations are going in and using innovative
new microfinancing schemes, like, pay-as-you-go solar, so that people can buy
the power they need in increments, sometimes even on their cell phone. One company, Azuri, has distributed
tens of thousands of units across 11 countries,
from Rwanda to Uganda. They estimate that they've powered
over 30 million hours of electricity and over 10 million hours
of cell phone charging. What about the giant growing
economies of China and India? Well, climate impacts might seem
a little further down the road, but air quality impacts
are right here today. And they know that clean energy
is essential to powering their future. So China is investing hundreds
of billions of dollars in clean energy. They're flooding coal mines, and they're putting floating
solar panels on the surface. They also have a panda-shaped solar farm. (Applause) (Laughter) Yes, they're still burning coal. But they've shut down
all the coal plants around Beijing. And in India, they're looking to replace a quarter of a billion
incandescent light bulbs with LEDs, which will save them
seven billion dollars in energy costs. They're investing in green jobs, and they're looking to decarbonize
their entire vehicle fleet. India may be the first country
to industrialize without relying primarily on fossil fuels. The world is changing. But it just isn't changing fast enough. Too often, we picture this problem as a giant boulder
sitting at the bottom of a hill, with only a few hands on it,
trying to roll it up the hill. But in reality, that boulder
is already at the top of the hill. And it's got hundreds of millions
of hands, maybe even billions on it, pushing it down. It just isn't going fast enough. So how do we speed up that giant boulder
so we can fix climate change in time? You guessed it. The number one way is by talking about it. The bottom line is this: climate change is affecting you and me
right here, right now, in the places where we live. But by working together, we can fix it. Sure, it's a daunting problem. Nobody knows that more
than us climate scientists. But we can't give in to despair. We have to go out and actively look
for the hope that we need, that will inspire us to act. And that hope begins
with a conversation today. Thank you. (Applause)"

I'm afraid by what I see. I sincerely want to believe that technology can bring us the techno-utopia that we've been promised, but, you see, I've spent a career in law enforcement, and that's informed my perspective on things. I've been a street police officer, an undercover investigator, a counter-terrorism strategist, and I've worked in more than 70 countries around the world. I've had to see more than my fair share of violence and the darker underbelly of society, and that's informed my opinions. My work with criminals and terrorists has actually been highly educational. They have taught me a lot, and I'd like to be able to share some of these observations with you. Today I'm going to show you the flip side of all those technologies that we marvel at, the ones that we love. In the hands of the TED community, these are awesome tools which will bring about great change for our world, but in the hands of suicide bombers, the future can look quite different. I started observing technology and how criminals were using it as a young patrol officer. In those days, this was the height of technology. Laugh though you will, all the drug dealers and gang members with whom I dealt had one of these long before any police officer I knew did. Twenty years later, criminals are still using mobile phones, but they're also building their own mobile phone networks, like this one, which has been deployed in all 31 states of Mexico by the narcos. They have a national encrypted radio communications system. Think about that. Think about the innovation that went into that. Think about the infrastructure to build it. And then think about this: Why can't I get a cell phone signal in San Francisco? (Laughter) How is this possible? (Laughter) It makes no sense. (Applause) We consistently underestimate what criminals and terrorists can do. Technology has made our world increasingly open, and for the most part, that's great, but all of this openness may have unintended consequences. Consider the 2008 terrorist attack on Mumbai. The men that carried that attack out were armed with AK-47s, explosives and hand grenades. They threw these hand grenades at innocent people as they sat eating in cafes and waited to catch trains on their way home from work. But heavy artillery is nothing new in terrorist operations. Guns and bombs are nothing new. What was different this time is the way that the terrorists used modern information communications technologies to locate additional victims and slaughter them. They were armed with mobile phones. They had BlackBerries. They had access to satellite imagery. They had satellite phones, and they even had night vision goggles. But perhaps their greatest innovation was this. We've all seen pictures like this on television and in the news. This is an operations center. And the terrorists built their very own op center across the border in Pakistan, where they monitored the BBC, al Jazeera, CNN and Indian local stations. They also monitored the Internet and social media to monitor the progress of their attacks and how many people they had killed. They did all of this in real time. The innovation of the terrorist operations center gave terrorists unparalleled situational awareness and tactical advantage over the police and over the government. What did they do with this? They used it to great effect. At one point during the 60-hour siege, the terrorists were going room to room trying to find additional victims. They came upon a suite on the top floor of the hotel, and they kicked down the door and they found a man hiding by his bed. And they said to him, ""Who are you, and what are you doing here?"" And the man replied, ""I'm just an innocent schoolteacher."" Of course, the terrorists knew that no Indian schoolteacher stays at a suite in the Taj. They picked up his identification, and they phoned his name in to the terrorist war room, where the terrorist war room Googled him, and found a picture and called their operatives on the ground and said, ""Your hostage, is he heavyset? Is he bald in front? Does he wear glasses?"" ""Yes, yes, yes,"" came the answers. The op center had found him and they had a match. He was not a schoolteacher. He was the second-wealthiest businessman in India, and after discovering this information, the terrorist war room gave the order to the terrorists on the ground in Mumbai. (""Kill him."") We all worry about our privacy settings on Facebook, but the fact of the matter is, our openness can be used against us. Terrorists are doing this. A search engine can determine who shall live and who shall die. This is the world that we live in. During the Mumbai siege, terrorists were so dependent on technology that several witnesses reported that as the terrorists were shooting hostages with one hand, they were checking their mobile phone messages in the very other hand. In the end, 300 people were gravely wounded and over 172 men, women and children lost their lives that day. Think about what happened. During this 60-hour siege on Mumbai, 10 men armed not just with weapons, but with technology, were able to bring a city of 20 million people to a standstill. Ten people brought 20 million people to a standstill, and this traveled around the world. This is what radicals can do with openness. This was done nearly four years ago. What could terrorists do today with the technologies available that we have? What will they do tomorrow? The ability of one to affect many is scaling exponentially, and it's scaling for good and it's scaling for evil. It's not just about terrorism, though. There's also been a big paradigm shift in crime. You see, you can now commit more crime as well. In the old days, it was a knife and a gun. Then criminals moved to robbing trains. You could rob 200 people on a train, a great innovation. Moving forward, the Internet allowed things to scale even more. In fact, many of you will remember the recent Sony PlayStation hack. In that incident, over 100 million people were robbed. Think about that. When in the history of humanity has it ever been possible for one person to rob 100 million? Of course, it's not just about stealing things. There are other avenues of technology that criminals can exploit. Many of you will remember this super cute video from the last TED, but not all quadcopter swarms are so nice and cute. They don't all have drumsticks. Some can be armed with HD cameras and do countersurveillance on protesters, or, as in this little bit of movie magic, quadcopters can be loaded with firearms and automatic weapons. Little robots are cute when they play music to you. When they swarm and chase you down the block to shoot you, a little bit less so. Of course, criminals and terrorists weren't the first to give guns to robots. We know where that started. But they're adapting quickly. Recently, the FBI arrested an al Qaeda affiliate in the United States, who was planning on using these remote-controlled drone aircraft to fly C4 explosives into government buildings in the United States. By the way, these travel at over 600 miles an hour. Every time a new technology is being introduced, criminals are there to exploit it. We've all seen 3D printers. We know with them that you can print in many materials ranging from plastic to chocolate to metal and even concrete. With great precision I actually was able to make this just the other day, a very cute little ducky. But I wonder to myself, for those people that strap bombs to their chests and blow themselves up, how might they use 3D printers? Perhaps like this. You see, if you can print in metal, you can print one of these, and in fact you can also print one of these too. The UK I know has some very strict firearms laws. You needn't bring the gun into the UK anymore. You just bring the 3D printer and print the gun while you're here, and, of course, the magazines for your bullets. But as these get bigger in the future, what other items will you be able to print? The technologies are allowing bigger printers. As we move forward, we'll see new technologies also, like the Internet of Things. Every day we're connecting more and more of our lives to the Internet, which means that the Internet of Things will soon be the Internet of Things To Be Hacked. All of the physical objects in our space are being transformed into information technologies, and that has a radical implication for our security, because more connections to more devices means more vulnerabilities. Criminals understand this. Terrorists understand this. Hackers understand this. If you control the code, you control the world. This is the future that awaits us. There has not yet been an operating system or a technology that hasn't been hacked. That's troubling, since the human body itself is now becoming an information technology. As we've seen here, we're transforming ourselves into cyborgs. Every year, thousands of cochlear implants, diabetic pumps, pacemakers and defibrillators are being implanted in people. In the United States, there are 60,000 people who have a pacemaker that connects to the Internet. The defibrillators allow a physician at a distance to give a shock to a heart in case a patient needs it. But if you don't need it, and somebody else gives you the shock, it's not a good thing. Of course, we're going to go even deeper than the human body. We're going down to the cellular level these days. Up until this point, all the technologies I've been talking about have been silicon-based, ones and zeroes, but there's another operating system out there: the original operating system, DNA. And to hackers, DNA is just another operating system waiting to be hacked. It's a great challenge for them. There are people already working on hacking the software of life, and while most of them are doing this to great good and to help us all, some won't be. So how will criminals abuse this? Well, with synthetic biology you can do some pretty neat things. For example, I predict that we will move away from a plant-based narcotics world to a synthetic one. Why do you need the plants anymore? You can just take the DNA code from marijuana or poppies or coca leaves and cut and past that gene and put it into yeast, and you can take those yeast and make them make the cocaine for you, or the marijuana, or any other drug. So how we use yeast in the future is going to be really interesting. In fact, we may have some really interesting bread and beer as we go into this next century. The cost of sequencing the human genome is dropping precipitously. It was proceeding at Moore's Law pace, but then in 2008, something changed. The technologies got better, and now DNA sequencing is proceeding at a pace five times that of Moore's Law. That has significant implications for us. It took us 30 years to get from the introduction of the personal computer to the level of cybercrime we have today, but looking at how biology is proceeding so rapidly, and knowing criminals and terrorists as I do, we may get there a lot faster with biocrime in the future. It will be easy for anybody to go ahead and print their own bio-virus, enhanced versions of ebola or anthrax, weaponized flu. We recently saw a case where some researchers made the H5N1 avian influenza virus more potent. It already has a 70 percent mortality rate if you get it, but it's hard to get. Engineers, by moving around a small number of genetic changes, were able to weaponize it and make it much more easy for human beings to catch, so that not thousands of people would die, but tens of millions. You see, you can go ahead and create new pandemics, and the researchers who did this were so proud of their accomplishments, they wanted to publish it openly so that everybody could see this and get access to this information. But it goes deeper than that. DNA researcher Andrew Hessel has pointed out quite rightly that if you can use cancer treatments, modern cancer treatments, to go after one cell while leaving all the other cells around it intact, then you can also go after any one person's cell. Personalized cancer treatments are the flip side of personalized bioweapons, which means you can attack any one individual, including all the people in this picture. How will we protect them in the future? What to do? What to do about all this? That's what I get asked all the time. For those of you who follow me on Twitter, I will be tweeting out the answer later on today. (Laughter) Actually, it's a bit more complex than that, and there are no magic bullets. I don't have all the answers, but I know a few things. In the wake of 9/11, the best security minds put together all their innovation and this is what they created for security. If you're expecting the people who built this to protect you from the coming robopocalypse — (Laughter) — uh, you may want to have a backup plan. (Laughter) Just saying. Just think about that. (Applause) Law enforcement is currently a closed system. It's nation-based, while the threat is international. Policing doesn't scale globally. At least, it hasn't, and our current system of guns, border guards, big gates and fences are outdated in the new world into which we're moving. So how might we prepare for some of these specific threats, like attacking a president or a prime minister? This would be the natural government response, to hide away all our government leaders in hermetically sealed bubbles. But this is not going to work. The cost of doing a DNA sequence is going to be trivial. Anybody will have it and we will all have them in the future. So maybe there's a more radical way that we can look at this. What happens if we were to take the President's DNA, or a king or queen's, and put it out to a group of a few hundred trusted researchers so they could study that DNA and do penetration testing against it as a means of helping our leaders? Or what if we sent it out to a few thousand? Or, controversially, and not without its risks, what happens if we just gave it to the whole public? Then we could all be engaged in helping. We've already seen examples of this working well. The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project is staffed by journalists and citizens where they are crowd-sourcing what dictators and terrorists are doing with public funds around the world, and, in a more dramatic case, we've seen in Mexico, a country that has been racked by 50,000 narcotics-related murders in the past six years. They're killing so many people they can't even afford to bury them all in anything but these unmarked graves like this one outside of Ciudad Juarez. What can we do about this? The government has proven ineffective. So in Mexico, citizens, at great risk to themselves, are fighting back to build an effective solution. They're crowd-mapping the activities of the drug dealers. Whether or not you realize it, we are at the dawn of a technological arms race, an arms race between people who are using technology for good and those who are using it for ill. The threat is serious, and the time to prepare for it is now. I can assure you that the terrorists and criminals are. My personal belief is that, rather than having a small, elite force of highly trained government agents here to protect us all, we're much better off having average and ordinary citizens approaching this problem as a group and seeing what we can do. If we all do our part, I think we'll be in a much better space. The tools to change the world are in everybody's hands. How we use them is not just up to me, it's up to all of us. This was a technology I would frequently deploy as a police officer. This technology has become outdated in our current world. It doesn't scale, it doesn't work globally, and it surely doesn't work virtually. We've seen paradigm shifts in crime and terrorism. They call for a shift to a more open form and a more participatory form of law enforcement. So I invite you to join me. After all, public safety is too important to leave to the professionals. Thank you. (Applause) (Applause)"

a TED Talk formula: ""Give a talk on a round, red rug."" ""Share a childhood story."" ""Divulge a personal secret."" ""End with an inspiring call to action."" No. That's not how to think of a TED Talk. In fact, if you overuse those devices, you're just going to come across
as clichéd or emotionally manipulative. But there is one thing that all
great TED Talks have in common, and I would like to share
that thing with you, because over the past 12 years,
I've had a ringside seat, listening to many hundreds
of amazing TED speakers, like these. I've helped them prepare
their talks for prime time, and learned directly from them their secrets of what
makes for a great talk. And even though these speakers
and their topics all seem completely different, they actually do have
one key common ingredient. And it's this: Your number one task as a speaker is to transfer into your listeners' minds
an extraordinary gift -- a strange and beautiful object
that we call an idea. Let me show you what I mean. Here's Haley. She is about to give a TED Talk and frankly, she's terrified. (Video) Presenter: Haley Van Dyck! (Applause) Over the course of 18 minutes, 1,200 people, many of whom
have never seen each other before, are finding that their brains
are starting to sync with Haley's brain and with each other. They're literally beginning to exhibit
the same brain-wave patterns. And I don't just mean
they're feeling the same emotions. There's something even more
startling happening. Let's take a look inside
Haley's brain for a moment. There are billions of interconnected
neurons in an impossible tangle. But look here, right here -- a few million of them
are linked to each other in a way which represents a single idea. And incredibly, this exact pattern
is being recreated in real time inside the minds of everyone listening. That's right; in just a few minutes, a pattern involving millions of neurons is being teleported into 1,200 minds, just by people listening to a voice
and watching a face. But wait -- what is an idea anyway? Well, you can think of it
as a pattern of information that helps you understand
and navigate the world. Ideas come in all shapes and sizes, from the complex and analytical to the simple and aesthetic. Here are just a few examples
shared from the TED stage. Sir Ken Robinson -- creativity
is key to our kids' future. (Video) Sir Ken Robinson:
My contention is that creativity now is as important in education as literacy, and we should treat it
with the same status. Chris Anderson: Elora Hardy --
building from bamboo is beautiful. (Video) Elora Hardy:
It is growing all around us, it's strong, it's elegant,
it's earthquake-resistant. CA: Chimamanda Adichie --
people are more than a single identity. (Video) Chimamanda Adichie:
The single story creates stereotypes, and the problem with stereotypes
is not that they are untrue, but that they are incomplete. CA: Your mind is teeming with ideas, and not just randomly. They're carefully linked together. Collectively they form
an amazingly complex structure that is your personal worldview. It's your brain's operating system. It's how you navigate the world. And it is built up out of millions
of individual ideas. So, for example, if one little
component of your worldview is the idea that kittens are adorable, then when you see this, you'll react like this. But if another component of your worldview is the idea that leopards are dangerous, then when you see this, you'll react a little bit differently. So, it's pretty obvious why the ideas that make up
your worldview are crucial. You need them to be as reliable
as possible -- a guide, to the scary but wonderful
real world out there. Now, different people's worldviews
can be dramatically different. For example, how does your worldview react
when you see this image: (Video) Dalia Mogahed:
What do you think when you look at me? ""A woman of faith,""
""an expert,"" maybe even ""a sister""? Or ""oppressed,"" ""brainwashed,"" ""a terrorist""? CA: Whatever your answer, there are millions of people out there
who would react very differently. So that's why ideas really matter. If communicated properly,
they're capable of changing, forever, how someone thinks about the world, and shaping their actions both now
and well into the future. Ideas are the most powerful force
shaping human culture. So if you accept that your number one task
as a speaker is to build an idea inside the minds of your audience, here are four guidelines
for how you should go about that task: One, limit your talk
to just one major idea. Ideas are complex things; you need to slash back your content
so that you can focus on the single idea
you're most passionate about, and give yourself a chance
to explain that one thing properly. You have to give context,
share examples, make it vivid. So pick one idea, and make it the through-line
running through your entire talk, so that everything you say
links back to it in some way. Two, give your listeners a reason to care. Before you can start building things
inside the minds of your audience, you have to get their permission
to welcome you in. And the main tool to achieve that? Curiosity. Stir your audience's curiosity. Use intriguing, provocative questions to identify why something
doesn't make sense and needs explaining. If you can reveal a disconnection
in someone's worldview, they'll feel the need
to bridge that knowledge gap. And once you've sparked that desire, it will be so much easier
to start building your idea. Three, build your idea, piece by piece, out of concepts that your audience
already understands. You use the power of language to weave together
concepts that already exist in your listeners' minds -- but not your language, their language. You start where they are. The speakers often forget that many
of the terms and concepts they live with are completely unfamiliar
to their audiences. Now, metaphors can play a crucial role
in showing how the pieces fit together, because they reveal
the desired shape of the pattern, based on an idea that the listener
already understands. For example, when Jennifer Kahn wanted to explain the incredible
new biotechnology called CRISPR, she said, ""It's as if, for the first time, you had a word processor to edit DNA. CRISPR allows you to cut and paste
genetic information really easily."" Now, a vivid explanation like that
delivers a satisfying aha moment as it snaps into place in our minds. It's important, therefore,
to test your talk on trusted friends, and find out which parts
they get confused by. Four, here's the final tip: Make your idea worth sharing. By that I mean, ask yourself the question: ""Who does this idea benefit?"" And I need you to be honest
with the answer. If the idea only serves you
or your organization, then, I'm sorry to say,
it's probably not worth sharing. The audience will see right through you. But if you believe that the idea
has the potential to brighten up someone else's day or change someone else's
perspective for the better or inspire someone to do
something differently, then you have the core ingredient
to a truly great talk, one that can be a gift to them
and to all of us."
