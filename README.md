# Have TED Talks Gotten Worse?

This project explores trends in TED Talks, analyzing factors like view count, duration, and publication date. In the second part, transcripts of these videos are used to analyze the complexity of the vocabulary used and other factors to reach a conclusion. Using Python and R we visualize insights such as:  

- Most popular TED Talks by view count  
- Trends over time, including yearly patterns and seasonal variations  
- Relationship between talk duration and view count  
- Time decay model to evaluate how views accumulate over time  

## Key Features  
- Web scraping using Python
- Data cleaning and preprocessing in R  
- ?
