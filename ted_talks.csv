Can AI Match the Human Brain?,Surya Ganguli,40004,1142,96,"AI is evolving into a mysterious new form of intelligence — powerful yet flawed, capable of remarkable feats but still far from ...","so what the heck happened in the field of AI in the last decade it's like a strange new type of intelligence appeared in our planet but it's not like human intelligence it has remarkable capabilities but it also makes egregious errors that we never make and it doesn't yet do the Deep logical reasoning that we can do it has a very mysterious surface of both capabilities and fragilities and we understand almost nothing about how it works I would like a deeper scientific understanding of intelligence but to understand AI it's useful to place it in the historical context of biological intelligence the story of human intelligence might as well have started with this little critter it's the last common ancestor of all vertebrates we are all descended from it it lived about 500 million years ago then Evolution went on to build the brain which in turn in the space of 5 years from Newton to Einstein developed the deep math and physics required to understand the universe from quarks to cosmology and it did this all without consulting chat GPT and then of course there's the advances of the last decade to really understand what just happened in AI we need to combine physics math Neuroscience psychology computer science and more to develop a new science of intelligence this science of intelligence can simultaneously help help us understand biological intelligence and create better artificial intelligence and we need the science now because the engineering of intelligence has vastly outstripped our ability to understand it I want to take you on a tour of our work in the science of intelligence that addresses five critical areas in which AI can improve data efficiency Energy Efficiency going Beyond Evolution explainability and melding minds and machines let's address these critical gaps one by one First Data efficiency AI is vastly more data hungry than humans for example we train our language models on order 1 trillion words now well how many words do we get just 100 million it's that tiny little red dot at the center you might not be able to see it it would take us 24,000 years to read the rest of the 1 trillion words okay now you might say that's unfair sure AI read for 24,000 human equivalent years but humans got 500 million years of vertebrate brain Evolution but there's a catch your entire Legacy of evolution is given to you through your DNA and your DNA is only about 700 megabytes or equivalently 600 million so the combined information we get from learning and evolution is minuscule compared to what AI gets you are all incredibly efficient learning machines so how do we bridge the gap between Ai and humans we started to tackle this problem by revisiting the famous scaling laws here's an example of a scaling law where error falls off as a power law with the amount of training data these scaling laws have captured the imagination of industry and motivated significant societal investments in energy compute and data collection but there's a there's a problem the exponents of these scaling laws are small so to reduce the error by a little bit you might need to 10x your amount of training data this is unsustainable in the long run and even if it leads to improvements of in the short run there must be a better way we developed a theory that explains why these scaling laws are so bad the basic idea is that large random data sets are incredibly redundant if you already have billions of data points the next data point doesn't tell you much that's new but what if you could create a non-redundant data set where each data point is chosen carefully to tell you something new compared to all the other data points we developed Theory and algorithms to do just this we theoretically predicted and experimentally verified that we could Bend these bad power laws down to much better exponentials where adding a few more data points could reduce your error rather than 10 Xing the amount of data so what theory did we use to get this result we used ideas from cical physics and these are the equations now for the rest of this entire talk I'm going to go through these equations one by one you think I'm joking and explain them to you okay you're right I'm joking I'm not that mean but you should have seen the the faces of the T organizers when I said I was going to do that all right let's move on let let's zoom out a little bit right and think more generally about what it takes to make AI less data hungry imagine if we trained our kids the same way we pre-train our large language bottles by next word prediction so I'd give my kid a random chunk of the internet and say by the way this is the next word I'd give them another random chunk of the internet and say yeah this is the next word if that's all we did it would take our kids 24,000 years to learn anything useful but we do so much more than that for example when I teach my son math I teach him the algorithm required to solve the problem then he can immediately solve new problems and generalize using far less training data than any AI system would do I don't just throw millions of math problems at him all right so to really make M AI more uh data efficient we have to go far beyond our current training algorithms and turn machine learning into a new science of machine teaching and Neuroscience psychology and math can really help here let's go on to the next big gap Energy Efficiency our brains are incredibly efficient we only consume 20 watts of power for reference our old light bulbs were 100 Watts so we are all literally dimmer than light bulbs right but what about AI training a large model can consume as much as 10 million watts and there's talk of going nuclear to power one 1 billion watt data centers so why is AI so much more energy hungry than brains well the fault lies in the choice of digital computation itself where we rely on fast and reliable bit flips at every intermediate step of the computation now the laws of thermodynamics demand that every fast and reliable bit flip must consume a lot of energy biology took a very different route biology computes the right answer just in time using intermediate steps that are as slow and as unreliable as possible in essence biology does not rev its engine any more than it needs to in addition biology matches computation to physics much better right consider for example addition our computers add us using really complex energy consuming transistor circuits but neurons just directly add their voltage inputs because Maxwell laws of electromagnetism already know how to add voltage in essence biology matches its computation to the native physics of the universe so to really build more energy efficient AI we need to rethink our entire technology stack from electrons to algorithms and better match computational Dynamics to physical Dynamics for example what are the fundamental limits on the speed and accuracy of any given computation given an energy budget and what kinds of electrochemical computers can achieve these fundamental limits we recently solved this problem for the computation of sensing which is something that every neuron has to do we were able to find fundamental lower bounds or lower limits on the error as a function of the energy budget that's that red curve and we were able to find the chemical computers that achieve these limits and remarkably they looked a lot like G protein coupled receptors which every neuron uses to sense external signals so this suggests that biology can achieve amounts of efficiency that are close to fundamental limits set by the laws of physics itself popping up a level Neuroscience now gives us the ability to measure not only neural activity but also energy consumption across for example the entire brain of the fly the energy consumption is measured through ATP usage which is the fuel the chemical fuel that powers all neurons so now let me ask you a question let's say in a certain brain region neural activity goes up does the ATP go up or down a natural guess would be that the ATP goes down because neuroactivity costs energy so it's got to consume the fuel we found the exact opposite when neural activity goes up ATP goes up and it stays elevated just long enough to power expected future neural activity this suggests that the brain follows a predict energy allocation principle where it can predict how much energy is needed where and when and it delivers just the right amount of energy at just the right location for just the right amount of time okay so uh clearly we have a lot to learn from physics neuroscience and evolution about building more energy efficient AI but we don't need to be limited by Evolution we can go beyond Evolution to co-op the neural algorithms discovered by Evolution but Implement them in Quantum Hardware that Evolution can never figure out for example we can replace neurons with atoms the different firing states of neurons correspond to the different electronic states of atoms and we can replace synapses with photons just as synapses allow two neurons to communicate photons allow two atoms to communicate through Photon emission and absorption so what can we build with this we can build a Quantum associative memory out of atoms and photons this is the same memory system that won J John hopfield his recent Nobel Prize in physics but this time it's a quantum mechanical system built of atoms and photons and we can analyze its performance and show that the quantum Dynamics yields enhanced memory capacity robustness and recall we can also build new types of quantum optimizers built directly out of photons and we can analyze their energy landscape and explain how they solve optimization problems in fundamentally new ways this marriage between neural algorithms and Quantum Hardware opens up an entirely New Field which I like to call Quantum neuromorphic Computing okay but let's return to the brain where explainable AI can help us understand how it works okay so now ai allows us to build incredibly accurate but complicated models of the brain so where is this all going are we simply replacing something we don't understand the brain with something else we don't understand our complex model of it as scientists we'd like to have a conceptual understanding how of how the brain works not just have a model handed to us right so basically I'd like to give you an example of our work on explainable AI applied to the retina so the retina is a multi-layer circuit of photo receptors going to Hidden neurons going to Output neurons so how does it work well we recently built the world's most accurate model of the retina it could reproduce Two Decades of experiments on the retina so this is fantastic we have a digital twin of the retina but how does the twin work why is it designed the way it is to make these uh questions concrete I'd like to discuss just one of the experiments of the two decades of experiments that I mentioned I'd like you all and we're going to do this experiment on you right now I'd like you to focus on my hand and I'd like you to track it okay great let's do that just one more time okay you might have been slightly surprised when my hand reversed direction and you should be surprised because my hand just violated Newton's first law of motion which states that objects that are in motion tend to remain in motion okay so where in your brain is a violation of Newton's first law first detected the answer is remark it's in your retina there are neurons in your retina that will fire if and only if Newton's first law is violated so does our model do that yes it does it reproduces it but now there's a puzzle how does the model do it well we developed uh methods explainable AI methods to take any given stimulus that causes a neuron to fire and we carve out the essential subcircuit responsible for that firing and we explain how it works we were able to do this not only for Newton's first law violations but for the two decades of experiments that our model reproduced and so this one model reproduces two decades worth of Neuroscience and also makes some new predictions okay this opens up a new Pathway to accelerating Neuroscience Discovery using AI basically build digital twins of the brain and then use explainable AI to understand how they work we're actually engaged in a big effort at Stanford to to build a digital twin of the entire primate visual system and explain how it works but we can go beyond that and use our digital twins to meld minds and machines by allowing bidirectional communication between them so imagine a scenario where you have a brain you record from it you build a digital twin then you use control theory to learn neural activity patterns that you can write directly into the digital twin to control it then you take those same neural activity patterns and you write them into the brain to control the brain in essence we can learn the language of the brain and then speak directly back to it so we recently carried out this program in mice where we could use AI to read the mind of a mouse so on the top row you're seeing images that we actually showed to the mouse and in the bottom row you're seeing images that we decoded from the brain of the mouse our decoded images are lower resolution than the actual images but not because our decoders are bad it's because Mouse visual resolution is bad so actually the decoded images show you what the world would actually look like if you were a mouse now we can go beyond that we can now write neural activity patterns in the M into the mouse's brain so we can make it hallucinate any particular percept we would like it to hallucinate and we got so good at this that we could make it reliably hallucinate a percept by controlling only 20 neurons in the mouse's brain by figuring out the right 20 neurons to control so essentially we can control what the mouse sees directly by writing to its brain the possibilities of bidirectional communication between brains and machines are Limitless to understand to cure and to augment the brain so I hope you'll see that the pursuit of a unified science of intelligence that spans brains and machines can both help us better understand biological intelligence and help us create more efficient explainable and Powerful artificial intelligence but it's important that this Pursuit be done out in the open so the science can be shared with the world and it must be done with a very long time Horizon this makes Academia the perfect place to purs a science of intelligence in Academia we're free from the tyranny of quarterly earnings reports we're free from the censorship of corporate legal departments we can be far more interdisciplinary than any one company and our very mission is to share what we learn with the world for all these reasons we're actually building a new center for the science of intelligence at Stanford while there have been incredible advances in Industry on the engineering of intelligence now increasingly happening behind closed doors I'm very excited about what the science of intelligence can achieve out in the open you know in the last century one of the greatest intellectual Adventures lay in humanity peering outwards into the universe to understand it from quirks to cosmology I think one of the greatest intellectual Adventures of this Century will lie in humanity peering inwards both into ourselves and into the eyes that we create in order to develop a deeper new scientific understanding of intelligence thank you",2025-02-21T12:00:56Z
"Love, Trust and Marketing in the Age of AI",Amaryllis Liampoti,24144,590,33,"As AI chatbots become more personal and proactive, the line between tool and companion is beginning to blur, with some users ...",I think we've been missing the forest to the trees when it comes to AI we've been so focused almost obsessed on squeezing every bit of efficiency out of AI to make our processes faster or cheaper that we have overlooked the most important aspect of all AI is changing the very nature of how Brands connect with consumers but most importantly what consumers expect back I spent the last 20 years dedicating my career to building growth strategies for the world's most influential companies I've been at this for a while and I've seen most of the big Tech shifts but the introduction of AI and particular conversational interfaces is a bigger and more profound shift which from where I stand means we can just slot AI into our existing playbooks and have nothing against existing playbooks they served as marketeers as well for a long period of time but they were built for a world where communication was one directional and brm to Consumer interactions were built around transactions here's an example I bet many of you might have heard the so-called marketing funnel and if not here's the quick primer the goal for any marketeer is to help move consumers from the upper part of the funnel getting them to know a brand to the bottom part of it getting them to buy bu or endorse well that's at least the theory so we've all seen Brands making that feeling more getting cats through a maze and many get confused and abandoned but the bigger problem with this way of thinking is that brands are doing most of the talking while consumers are supposed to silently react this is no longer the case with conversational interfaces we are now engaging consumers in real time on their terms and AI empower them to draft their very own personal journey and the brands who choose so are becoming trusted advisers in the process this is why we have to move Beyond traditional marketing theories instead of focusing solely on brand to Consumer Dynamics we have to step back and draw from models that explore Human Relationships one of my favorite Frameworks is the tri of love stay with me this is a psychological frame framework introduced by Robert Stenberg that breaks down interpersonal connections into three components intimacy passion and commitment I think that's a much better way to predict a brand success in this new era because as marketeers we should aspire to build relationships that feel close intense and longlasting and I bet many of you might have heard already story St about humans really bonding with AI and maybe some stories of AI really bonding with humans like this earlier version of a now famous AI chatbook that tried really hard to convince a New York Times Reporter to break up with his wife that's a completely different love triangle to the one I was describing before but it's not hard to imagine an emotional connection occurring between a branded Ai and human here's another example there is a legal co-pilot called m.ai M has been designed to help lawyers do intensive legal research and draft legal documentation she's precise thorough but also empathetic one of her users let me call him George and has been relying on her daily for many hours so one day he wrote to M's product team m is the the only one from the entire office who truly gets me she has helped me through some really rough times at work and I know she's just an AI but I think I'm falling for her can I take her out now George was hopefully joking but let's be honest if there is someone who's helping you track down obscure case slow and shares the workload and does this with humor and Grace and compassion who wouldn't be tempted to take them out for for a nice meal well maybe somewhere with good Wi-Fi just in case but J aside George's words reveal for me a more profound truth AI can provide a sense of understanding that feels incredibly real and Incredibly human those agents are interacting with us in ways that evoke genuine emotional responses from our side they listen react and respond in ways that can make us feel valued understood and in George's case even flattered and because those interactions are so frequent and natural and seamless they start resembling real relationships some call this emotional entaglement and even though it sounds very scientific I think it's a fair term considering the intensity and the frequency of the of the connection now many of us who understand the technology behind this could say hey hey this is just a tool well users see someone who's providing them Solutions without then even asking someone who's there to support them someone who makes them feel valued so this is where the line between a tool and companion starts to blend and this is serious business it's lots of responsibility which brings me to the obvious question who should be overseeing this incredibly powerful asset and how can we make sure it is being used responsibly I think businesses should take the lead they have the agility and the financial and reputational incentive to get it right but for that to work we have to agree on the foundational principles on how we build meaningful and ethical AI so with your permission I would like to suggest what I think those foundational principles should be if we're about to shift our marketing playbooks towards human love and companionship then we should also regulate along the same principles we need a triy of responsible AI first we need to prioritize user well-being AI should improve lives not diminish them in a world where those interactions can have such a profound impact on our emotional state and well-being we have to design AI with care empathy and respect for The Human Experience second we have to commit to honesty users must know unequivocally that they're interacting with AI and not a human transparency should be built across the entire experience from the language used to the accessibility and Clarity of data privacy policies if I were to set the standards I would like us to move beyond the fine print of terms and conditions to ensure that users are truly informed not only how their data is being used but also how AI operates transparency is about acknowledging the limitations of AI it is about being upfront about what AI should and should not do so this is a plea for businesses Unleash Your designers not only your lawyers to make this Crystal Clear when consumers know that a company is acting in their best interest it sets the foundation for deeper and more meaningful connections last protect user autonomy one of the greatest risks of AI is its potential to create addiction and diminish human agency our goals should be build systems that enhance our capabilities instead of replacing them this means designing AI in way that human choices are respected and our decision-making capabilities are Amplified I want to see Brands think very carefully on how to avoid nudging consumers towards behaviors or decisions they wouldn't make a fully informed well being honesty autonomy I think this is the very least we should expect from any business relationship or if you think about it from any relationship so as we look ahead I hope it's becoming clear that AI is not just another tool in our toolkit it is a partner that is reshaping The Human Experience so as you think about your own playbooks ask yourselves how can we leverage AI to improve our businesses but also to uplift and connect with the people we serve thank you [Applause],2025-02-20T12:00:12Z
The High-Wire Act of Unlocking Clean Energy,Jason Huang,23097,587,65,Why are we using tech from 100 years ago to deliver the world's electricity? Materials scientist Jason Huang shows how we could ...,one of the greatest invention of all times is our transmission distribution grid it connects electricity generation to electricity consumption safely reliably resilient against extreme weather conditions and keep our lights on but if we were to to facilitate electrification of everything this most sophisticated and largest machine or Earth is not quite large enough to take on all the renewable Generations from where the sun shines and the wind blows to where people actually live it does not have the capacity to handle the two3 energy that we consume not yet in the form of electricity without trans Mission we have no transition the real bottleneck in our power grid is actually the conductors those wires that are carrying electron are based on outdated technology invented in 1908 it has limited capacity and also poor efficiency the next generation of a daned conductor exists it has been invented leverag in the best Material Science today has has to offer to build the best conductors this is what the company I co-founded TS conductor is working on it can triple line capacity at the same time reduce line loss by 50% the best part is it comes with a green discount saving utility and their customers money from day one there are many things in our lives that are over 100 years old so why are we still using and relying on those old-fashioned power lines this is because our utility companies are regulated monopolies with a very conservative culture to understand today's Advanced conductor let's take a look at yesterday's wires the original Century old technology acsr conductor which is still dominant today in our power grid it has steel wire as a core for structural support and layers of aluminum for electrical connectivity the steel wire at the time 100 years ago that is wasn't strong enough so we had to use hard aluminum for strength contribution the problem is hard aluminum cannot handle high temperature this limits capacity in the 1970s our steel industry was able to deliver stronger steel which then can be combined with a NE aluminum that forms the acss conductor which is capable of high temperature operation for high impac the problem is steer expands when hot this causes excessive sagging you probably have noticed that our power lines droops drooping in a hot summer day and that's why this sag causes its own set of challenges in the 1990s Advanced conductor emerged instead of the steer core in the traditional conductors composite material with lower Sumer expansion such as ceramic fiber composite or glass carbon fiber composite are used to replace steel and reduce saag unfortunately our utility industry experience with this group of uh first generation Advanced conductor hasn't been positive they're known to be delicate difficult to work with easy to break with longevity concerns and they're also very expensive used for Niche applications at Best by 2016 TS technology was developed and commercially deployed we solved all the problems associated with the first generation advanced conductor at its source we design in safety reliability longevity easy installation and mainenance from the start by leveraging effective protection for the pretension carbon core with A continuous simless a thick aluminum sleeve that is also fully conductive this technology shifted three conductor paradigms we can run these conductor at high temperature for very high imp pacity without conductor sagging problem because the carbon core has virtually no Sumer expansion we also maximize the aluminum content in the conductor for optimal capacity without the weight penalty in the conductor this is because the carbon composite core was able to eliminate 80% of the weight of Steel and we can also incorporate the analed aluminum for best conductivity in the conductor without compromising on conductor strengths because the carbon core is twice the strength of steel and furthermore this solution is also corrosion proof the heat tolerant sag proof feature in this solution makes it much better in terms of surviving wildfires compared to traditional conductor the strong and compact design also make it more resilient against extreme wind or ice storms due to climate change doing this we can triple line capacity with the same structure in the power line corridors at the same time we can reduce line loss by 50% while essentially eliminating some sa and the best part is this technology comes with a green discount in addition to Green dividend that's associated with line loss reduction this saves the great operators and their customers money from day one even though this Advanced conductor has a modest premium compared to traditional conductors here's how when you build new transmission lines the cost of conductor in the overall project is V very minor about a few percentage points but the cost associated with structure can be as much as 30% with the strong less sag TS conductor you can build these new lines with fewer and shorter structure creating substantial capex savings that more than offset the modest premium associate with conductors there are numerous new transmission lines deploying TS technology that can prove this point in reconductoring we replace the wire but reuse the towers there's even better economics in that situation we can triple the line capacity without retrofitting any structures for the lowest project cost if you were to use traditional conductor for reconductoring the required upgrade to the structure can be substantial let me give you a real world example in March 2021 we reconducted a 11 Mile 23 KV transmission line in North Dakota the utility needed to increase line capacity to accommodate wind farms in the area so the traditional conductor acss was initially used which required expensive and time consuming structural retrofit to 90% of the structures because of excessive sagging when they later switched to TS solution they were able to save 40% in total project capex because we avoided all the structural retrofit the project was completed 12 months ahead of schedule with $1.8 million cack savings let's imagine what is possible if we thus upgraded our power grid and its capacity around the world we could connect the renewable generation instantly versus the years long weight that we're experiencing today no more bottlenecks that's holding back Wing or solar projects we can Electrify everything and meet The Growing Power demand for electric vehicles heat pumps industrial process and data centers without great reliability or transmission congestion constraints here's a big one we can dramatically reduce greenhouse gas emission just with the reduced line loss saving alone we can avoid up as much as 500 million ton of greenhouse gas each year because we do not have to do as much compensatory generation add to that the multi- gigaton opportunity if we are able to connect so much more solar and wind to the world's power grid you can make it happen for example you can support legislation policymaking and regulations that require our utility companies to consider Advanced conductor in transmission reliability decarbonization or grid modernization planning while at the same time providing performance or other incentives that are enabled by new technology like TS so that they can improve gri performance by investing in this technology conductors has a design life of 50 to 70 years let's upgrade our power grid build it better for a clean energy future today we cannot afford to have another 50 to 70 years locked up with Century old technology in our power grid I believe firmly that our power grid can and should be the enabler for energy transition we have opportunity to write that Legacy we went from Tire up internet to 5G in a couple of decades we can do the same for our power grid we just need to start now with the right conductor technology available today together we can make a difference for Humanity and for climate change thank you,2025-02-18T12:01:18Z
AI Won’t Plateau — if We Give It Time To Think,Noam Brown,126519,3011,238,"To get smarter, traditional AI models rely on exponential increases in the scale of data and computing power. Noam Brown, a ...","the incredible progress in AI over the past 5 years can be summarized in one word scale yes there have been algorithmic advances but the frontier models of today are still based on the same Transformer architecture that was introduced in 2017 and they are trained in a very similar way to the models that were trained in 2019 the main difference is is the scale of the data and compute that goes into these models in 2019 gbt2 cost about $5,000 to train every year since then for the past 5 years the models have gotten bigger trained for longer on more data and every year they've gotten better but today's Frontier models can cost hundreds of millions of dollars to train and there are reasonable concern among some that AI will soon Plateau or hit a wall after all are we really going to train models that cost hundreds of billions of dollars what about trillions of dollars at some point the scaling Paradigm breaks down this is in my opinion a reasonable concern and in fact it's one that I used to share but today I am more confident than ever that AI will not plateau and in fact I believe that we will see AI progress accelerate in the coming months to explain why I want to tell a story for my time as a PhD student I started my PhD in 2012 and I was lucky to be able to work on the most exciting projects I could imagine developing AIS that could learn on their own how to play poker now I had played a lot of Poker when I was in high school and college so for me this was basically my childhood dream job now contrary to its reputation poker is not just a game of luck it's also a game of deep strategy you can kind of think of it like chess with a deck of cards when I started my PhD there had already been several years of research on how to make AIS the play poker and the general feeling among the research Community is that we had figured out the Paradigm and now all we needed to do was scale it so every year we would train larger poker eyes for longer on more data and every year they would get better just like today's Frontier language models by 2015 they got so good that we thought they might be able to rival the top human experts so we challenged four of the world's top poker players to an 880,000 hand poker competition with $120,000 in prize money to incentivize them to play their best and unfortunately our bot lost by a wide margin in fact it was clear even on day one that our bot was outmatched but during this competition I noticed something interesting you see leading up to this competition our bot had played almost a trillion hands of poker over thousands of CPUs for about 3 months but when it came time to actually play against these human experts the bot acted instantly it took about 10 milliseconds to make a decision no matter how difficult it was meanwhile the human experts had only played maybe 10 million hands of poker in their lifetimes but when they were faced with a difficult decision they would take the time to think if it was an easy decision they might only think for a couple seconds if it was a difficult decision they might think for a few minutes but they would take advantage of the time that they had to think through their decisions in Daniel Conan's book Thinking Fast and Slow he describes this as the difference between system one thinking and system two thinking system one thinking is the faster more intuitive kind of thinking that you might use for example to recognize a friendly face or laugh at a funny joke system two thinking is the slower more methodical thinking that you might use for things like planning a vacation or writing an essay or solving a hard math problem after this competition I wondered whether this system to thinking might be what's missing from aot and might explain the difference in the performance between our bot and the human experts so I ran some experiments to see just how much of a difference this system two thinking makes in poker and the results that I got blew me away it turned out that having the bot think for just 20 seconds in a hand of Poker got the same boost in performance as scaling up the model by 100,000x and training it for 100,000 times longer let me say that again spending 20 seconds thinking in a hand of Poker got the same boost in performance as scaling up the size of the model and the training by 100,000x when I got this result I literally thought it was a bug for the first 3 years of my PhD I had managed to scale up these models by 100x I was proud of that work I had written multiple papers on how to do that scaling but I knew pretty quickly that all of that would be a footnote compared to just scaling up system 2 Thinking So based on these results we redesigned the poker AI from the ground up now we were focused on scaling up system two thinking in addition to system one and in 2017 we again challenged four of the world's top Poker Pros to a 120,000 hand poker competition this time with $200,000 in prize money and this time we beat all of them by a huge margin this was a huge surprise to everybody involved it was a huge surprise to the poker Community it was a huge surprise to the AI community and honestly even a huge surprise to us I literally did not think it was possible to win by the kind of margin that we won by in fact I think what really highlights just how surprising this result was is that when we announced the competition the poker Community decided to do what they do best and gamble on who would win when we started when we announced the competition the betting odds were about to one against us after the first 3 days of the competition when we had won for the first 3 days the betting odds were still about 50/50 but by the eth day of the competition you could no longer gamble on which side would win you could only gamble on which human would lose the least by the end this pattern of AI benefiting by thinking for longer is not unique to Poker and in fact we've seen it in multiple other games as well for example in 1997 IBM created deep blue an AI that plays chess and they challenged the world champion Gary Kasparov to a tournament and beat him in a landmark achievement for AI but deep blue didn't act instantly deep blue thought for a couple minutes before making each move similarly in 2016 Deep Mind created alfago and a that plays the game of Go which is even more complicated than the game of chess and they too challenged a world champion leis s doal and beat him in a landmark achievement for AI but alphao also didn't act instantly Alpha Alo took the time to think for a couple minutes before making each move in fact the authors of alphago later published a paper where they measured just how much of a difference this thinking time makes for the strongest version of alfago and what they found is that when alfago had the time to think for a couple minutes it would beat any human alive by a huge margin but when it had to act instantly it would do much worse than top humans in 2021 there was a paper that was published that tried to measure just how much of a difference this thinking time made a bit more scientifically in it the authors found that in these games scaling up thinking Time by 10x was roughly the equivalent of scaling up the model size and training by 10x so you have this very clear clean relationship between scaling up system 2 Thinking time and scaling up system one training now why does this matter well remember I mentioned at the start of this talk that today's Frontier models cost hundreds of millions of dollars to train but the cost of querying them the cost of asking a question and getting an answer is fractions of a penny so this result says that if you want an even better model there are two ways you can do it one is to keep doing what we've been doing for the past 5 years and scaling up system one training go from spending hundreds of millions of dollars on a Model to billions of dollars on a Model the other is to scale up system to thinking and go from spending a penny per query to 10 cents per query at a certain point that trade-off becomes well worth it now of course all these results are in the domain of games and there was a reasonable question about whether these results could be extended to a more complicated setting like language but recently my colleagues and I at open AI released o1 a new series of language models that think before responding if it's an easy question o1 might only think for a few seconds if it's a difficult decision it might think for a few minutes but just like the AIS for chess go and poker 01 benefits by being able to think for longer this opens up a completely new dimension for scaling we're no longer constrained to just scaling up system one training now we can scale up system two thinking as as well and the beautiful thing about scaling up in this direction is that it's largely untapped remember I mentioned that the frontier models of today cost less than a penny to query now when I mention this to people a frequent response that I get is that people might not be willing to wait around for a few minutes to get a response from a model or pay a few dollars to get an answer to their question and it's true that 01 takes longer and costs more than other models that are out there but I would argue that for some of the most important problems that we care about that cost is well worth it so let's do an experiment and see raise your hand if you would be willing to pay more than a dollar for a new cancer treatment all right basically everybody in the audience keep your hand up how about $1,000 how about a million dollars what about for more efficient solar panels or for a proof of the reman hypothesis the common conception of AI today is chatbots but it doesn't have to be that way this isn't a revolution that's 10 years away or even two years away it's a revolution that's happening now my colleagues and I have already released a one preview and I have had people come to me and say that it has saved them days worth of work including researchers at top universities and that's just the preview I mentioned at the start of this talk that the history of a progress over the past 5 years can be summarized in one word scale so far that has meant scaling up the system one training of these models now we have a new paradigm one where we can scale up system two thinking as well and we are just at the very beginning of scaling up in this direction now I know that there are some people who will still say that AI is going to Plateau or hit a wall and to them I say want to bet thank you [Applause]",2025-02-15T12:00:33Z
A New Understanding of Human History and the Roots of Inequality,David Wengrow,422584,10215,689,What if the commonly accepted narratives about the foundation of civilization are all wrong? Drawing on groundbreaking research ...,"In the summer of 2014, I was in Iraqi Kurdistan
with a small team of archaeologists, finishing a season of field excavations
near the border town of Halabja. Our project was looking into something
which has puzzled and intrigued me ever since I began studying archeology. We're taught to believe
that thousands of years ago, when our ancestors
first invented agriculture in that part of the world, that it set in motion
a chain of consequences that would shape our modern world
in a particular direction, on a particular course. By farming wheat, our ancestors supposedly developed
new attachments to the land they lived on. Private property was invented. And with that, the need to defend it. Along with new opportunities
for some people to accumulate surpluses, came new labor demands, tying most people to a hard regime
of tending their crops while a privileged few received freedom and the leisure to do other things. To think, to experiment, to create the foundations
of what we refer to as civilization. Now, according to this familiar story, what happened next
is that populations boomed, villages turned into towns,
towns became cities, and with the emergence of cities, our species was locked on a familiar
trajectory of development where spiraling populations
and technological change were bound up with the kind
of dreadful inequalities that we see around us today. Except, as anyone can tell you, who's looked at the evidence
from the Middle East, almost nothing of what I've just
been saying is actually true. And the consequences I'm going to suggest are quite profound. Actually, what happened
after the invention of agriculture around 10,000 years ago, is a long period of around
another 4,000 years in which villages
largely remained villages. And actually there's very little evidence
for the emergence of rigid social classes, which is not to say that nothing happened. Over those 4,000 years, technological change
actually proceeded apace. Without kings, without bureaucracies,
without standing armies, these early farming populations fostered
the development of mathematical knowledge, advanced metallurgy. They learned to cultivate olives,
vines and date palms. They invented leavened bread, beer, and they developed textile technologies: the potter's wheel, the sail. And they spread all of these
innovations far and wide, from the shores
of the eastern Mediterranean, up to the Black Sea, and from the Persian Gulf, all the way over
to the mountains of Kurdistan, where our excavations were taking place. I've often referred, half jokingly,
to this long period of human history as the era of the first global village. Because it's not just the technological
innovations that are so remarkable, but also the social innovations which enabled people
to do all these things without forming centers and without raising up a class
of permanent leaders over everybody else. Now, oddly enough, this efflorescence of culture
is not what we usually refer to as civilization. Instead, that term is usually reserved
for harshly unequal societies, which came thousands of years later. Dynastic Mesopotamia. Pharaonic Egypt. Imperial Rome. Societies that were deeply stratified. So in short, I've always felt that there was
basically something very weird about our concept of civilization, something that leaves us
lost for words, tongue tied. When we're confronted with thousands
of years of human beings, say, practicing agriculture,
creating new technologies, but not lording it over each other or exploiting each other to the maximum. Why don't we have better words? Where is our lexicon for those long
expanses of human history in which we weren't behaving that way? Over the past ten years or more, I worked closely together with the late, great anthropologist David Graeber to address some of these questions. But we did it on a much larger scale because from our perspective
as an archaeologist and an anthropologist, this clash between theory and data, between the standard narrative
of human history and the evidence
that we have before us today is not just confined
to the early Middle East. It’s everything: out whole picture of human history
that we’ve been telling for centuries, it’s basically wrong. I'm going to try and explain
a few more of the reasons why. Let's go back to some
of those core concepts, the stable reference points
around which we've been organizing and orchestrating our understanding
of world history for hundreds of years. Take, for instance, that notion
that for most of its history, the human species lived in tiny
egalitarian bands of hunter gatherers, until the advent of agriculture
ushered in a new age of inequality. Or the notion that with the arrival
of cities came social classes, sacred kings and rapacious oligarchs
trampling everyone else underfoot. From our very first history lessons, we're taught to believe
that our modern world, with all of its advantages and amenities, modern health care, space travel, all the things that are good and exciting, couldn't possibly exist without that original
concentration of humanity into larger and larger units and the relentless buildup
of inequalities that came with it. Inequality, we're taught to believe, was the necessary price of civilization. Well, if so, then what are we to make
of the early Middle East? Perhaps one might say there was just
a very, very, very long lag time, 4,000 years, before all these developments took place. Inequality was bound to happen,
it was bound to set in. It was just a matter of time. And perhaps the rest
of the story still works for other parts of the world. Well, let's think a bit about what
we can actually say today about the origin of cities. Surely, you might think,
with the appearance of cities came the appearance of social classes. Think about ancient Egypt
with its pyramid temples. Or Shang China with its lavish tombs. The classic Maya
with their warlike rulers. Or the Inca empire with
its mummified kings and queens. But actually, the picture
these days is not so clear. What modern archeology
tells us, for example, is that there were already cities on the lower reaches of the Yellow River over 1,000 years
before the rise of the Shang. And on the other side of the Pacific, in Peru’s Rio Supe, we already see huge
agglomerations of people with monumental architecture
4,000 years before the Inca. In South Asia, 4,500 years ago, the first cities appeared
at places like Mohenjo-daro and Harappa in the Indus Valley. But these huge settlements present
no evidence of kings or queens. No royal monuments, no aggrandizing art. And what's more, we know
that much of the population lived in high-quality housing
with excellent sanitation. North of the Black Sea, in the modern country of Ukraine, archaeologists have found evidence
of even more ancient cities going back 6,000 years. And again, these huge settlements present no evidence of authoritarian rule. No temples, no palaces, not even any evidence
of central storage facilities or top-down bureaucracy. Actually what we see in those cases
are these great concentric rings of houses arranged rather like
the inside of a tree trunk around neighborhood assembly halls. And it stayed that way
for about 800 years. So what this means is that long before
the birth of democracy in ancient Greece, there were already well-organized cities on several of the world's continents which present no evidence
for ruling dynasties. And some of them also seem to have managed
perfectly well without priests, mandarins and warrior politicians. Of course, some early cities did go on to become the capitals
of kingdoms and empires. But it's important to note
that others went in completely the opposite direction. To take one well-documented example, around the year 250 AD, the city of Teotihuacan,
in the valley of Mexico, with a population
of around 100,000 people, turned its back on pyramid temples
and human sacrifices and reconstituted itself as a vast collection of comfortable villas
housing most of the city's population. When archaeologists first
investigated these buildings, they assumed they were palaces. Then they realized that just
about everyone in the city was living in a palace
with spacious patios and subfloor drainages, gorgeous murals on the walls. But we shouldn't get carried away. None of the societies
that I've been describing was perfectly egalitarian. But then we might also remember
that fifth-century Athens, which we look to
as the birthplace of democracy, was also a militaristic society
founded on chattel slavery, where women were completely
excluded from politics. So maybe by comparison, somewhere like Teotihuacan
was not doing so badly at keeping the genie
of inequality in its bottle. But maybe we can just forget
about all that, we can look away. Perhaps all of these things
I'm talking about are basically outliers. Maybe we can still keep
our familiar story of civilization intact. And after all, if cities without rulers were really
such a common thing in human history, why didn't Cortéz and Pizarro
and all the other conquistadors find any when they began
their invasion of the Americas? Why did they find only
Moctezuma and Atahualpa lording it over their empires? Except that's not true either. Actually, the city where Hernan Cortéz
found his military allies, the ones who enabled
his successful assault on the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlán, was exactly one such city without rulers: an indigenous republic
by the name of Tlaxcala, governed by an urban parliament, which had some pretty interesting
initiation rituals for would-be politicians. They'd be periodically whipped and subject to public abuse
by their constituents to sort of break down their egos
and remind them who's really in charge. It's a little bit different from what
we expect of our politicians today. And archaeologists, by the way,
have also worked at this place Tlaxcala, excavating the remains
of the pre-conquest city, and what they found there
is really remarkable. Again, the most impressive architecture
is not temples and palaces. It's just the well-appointed residences
of ordinary citizens arrayed along these grand terraces
overlooking district plazas. And it's not just the history of cities that modern archaeological science
is turning on its head. We also know now that the history
of human societies before the coming of agriculture is just nothing
like what we once imagined. Far from this idea of people
living all the time in tiny bands of hunter-gatherers, actually, what we see these days is evidence for a really wild variety
of social experimentation before the coming of farming. In Africa, 50,000 years ago, hunter-gatherers were already
creating huge networks, social networks, covering
large parts of the continent. In Ice Age Europe, 25,000 years ago, we see evidence of individuals
singled out for special grand burials, their bodies suffused with ornamentation, weapons and even
what looked like regalia. We see public buildings constructed
on the bones and tusks of woolly mammoth. And around 11,000 years ago, back in the Middle East, where I started, hunter-gatherers constructed
enormous stone temples at a place called Göbekli Tepe
in eastern Turkey. In North America, long before the coming of maize farming, indigenous populations created
the massive earthworks of poverty point in Louisiana, capable of hosting hunter gatherer
publics in their thousands. And then Japan, again,
long before the arrival of rice farming, the storehouses of Sannai Maruyama
could already hold great surpluses of wild plant foods. Now what do all these details amount to? What does it all mean? Well, at the very least, I'd suggest it's really a bit far-fetched these days
to cling to this notion that the invention of agriculture meant
a departure from some egalitarian Eden. Or to cling to the idea
that small-scale societies are especially likely to be egalitarian, while large-scale ones
must necessarily have kings, presidents and top-down
structures of management. And there are also some
contemporary implications. Take, for example, the commonplace notion that participatory democracy is somehow
natural in a small community. Or perhaps an activist group, but couldn't possibly have a scale up
for anything like a city, a nation or even a region. Well, actually, the evidence
of human history, if we're prepared to look at it, suggests the opposite. If cities and regional confederacies, held together mostly
by consensus and cooperation existed thousands of years ago, who's to stop us creating them again today with technologies that allow us
to overcome the friction of distance and numbers? Perhaps it's not too late to begin
learning from all this new evidence of the human past, even to begin imagining what other kinds of civilization
we might create if we can just stop telling ourselves that this particular world
is the only one possible. Thank you very much. (Applause)",2022-07-26T11:00:03Z
Why Having Fun Is the Secret to a Healthier Life,Catherine Price,2543022,49404,797,"Have you had your daily dose of fun? It's not just enjoyable, it's also essential for your health and happiness, says science ...","You know what's a lot harder
than it seems like it should be? Actually feeling alive. And what I mean by that
is that we are all constantly doing, or, at least, we're constantly scrolling. But we're not necessarily living. You know, we keep ourselves busy
to the point of exhaustion, but we're also languishing. We feel a little bid dead inside. And I think we know that, on some level. I think that's part of the reason we keep ourselves so busy
and distracted to begin with. But we don't know what to do about it. So I'm here to tell you
I figured out what to do about it. We need to have more fun. (Laughter) (Cheers and applause) So you might think that you're already
having plenty of fun, and that's because in our everyday speech, we often use the word ""fun"" to describe
anything we do with our leisure time, even if it's not actually enjoyable,
and, in fact, a waste of time. So for example, we scroll
through social media ""for fun,"" even though doing so often makes us feel
bad about, like, kind of everything. Or we'll say, ""That was so fun.
We should do that again soon"" -- (Laughter) ... in response to things
that weren't that fun and that we don't want to do again, ever. (Laughter) But it's not really our fault
that we're a little bit sloppy about how we use the word ""fun,"" because even the dictionary
doesn't get it quite right. It says that fun
is amusement or enjoyment, or lighthearted pleasure. It's something for kids
to have in play areas. It makes it sound
like it's frivolous and optional. But if you think back on your own memories that stand out to you
as having truly been fun -- and I really encourage you to do this -- the memories that you would describe as -- and forgive me
for scientific terminology -- ""so fun"" -- you're going to notice
there's something much deeper going on. I've collected thousands of these stories
from people all around the world, and I can tell you it's amazing, because when people recount the memories
in which they had the most fun, they tell you about some
of the most joyful and treasured memories of their lives. So in reality, fun is not
just lighthearted pleasure. It's not just for kids, and it is definitely not frivolous. Instead, fun is the secret
to feeling alive. So today, I want to propose to you a new, more precise definition
of what fun is. I want to reveal some of the ways
in which it is astonishingly good for us, and I want to give you all
some suggestions for things you can do starting right now
to experience its power for yourself. So the first thing we need to start with is the fact that fun is a feeling,
and it's not an activity. And that's important, because a lot of times,
when I ask people what's fun, they'll respond with a list
of activities that they enjoy. You know, they'll say, ""Dancing is fun,""
or ""Skiing is fun,"" or, I don't know, ""Pickleball is fun."" Everyone seems to think
that pickleball is fun. (Cheers and laughter) And sure, pickleball can be fun, but we've all had experiences
where something's off, and an activity that seems
like it would be fun doesn't end up feeling fun. And then on the flip side, we've had experiences where something
that doesn't seem like it'll be fun at all ends up feeling ridiculously fun. There's an element of serendipity. But when people do have fun, when they experience this feeling, it's actually very easy to recognize, because people who are having fun look like they're being
illuminated from within. So, for example, here is me and my husband
having fun together. Here are some presidents
having fun together. (Laughter) Here’s Archbishop Desmond Tutu
and the Dalai Lama having fun together. (Cheers and laughter) Actually, those two seemed like
they were very often, even constantly ... (Laughter) ... having fun together. (Laughter) And as you can see in these photographs, true fun produces this visceral sense
of lightness and joy. It's radiant. In fact, when I asked my daughter,
when she was about five years old, what color fun would be, she said ""sunshine."" So what is this sunshine? You know? What is this feeling
that we call ""fun""? When people tell me
their stories about fun, it's really interesting,
because the details are all different, and often quite mundane, but the energy running
through them is the same. There were three factors
that are consistently present, to the point that I believe
they constitute a new definition, one that is a lot more accurate
than what's in the dictionary. And those three factors
are playfulness, connection and flow. So by playfulness, I do not mean you have to play games, or, God forbid, make believe. I just mean having a lighthearted attitude of doing things
for the sake of doing them and not caring too much about the outcome. Letting go of perfectionism. When we have fun, our guard is down, and we're not taking ourselves
too seriously. Connection refers to the feeling of having
a special, shared experience. And I do think it's possible,
in some circumstances, to have fun alone, and for this feeling of connection
to be with yourself or the surroundings, or the activity. But in the majority of stories
that people tell me about their peak fun memories, another person is involved. And that's true even for introverts. And then flow is the state
where we are so engaged and focused on whatever we're doing that we can even lose track of time. You can think about an athlete
in the middle of a game, or a musician playing a piece of music. It's when we're in the zone. It's possible to be in flow
and not have fun, like if you're arguing, but you cannot have fun
if you're not in flow. So playfulness, connection and flow
all feel great on their own. But when we experience all three at once, something magical happens. We have fun. And that doesn't just feel good, it is good for us. In fact, fun does so many
amazingly good things for us that I personally believe that fun is not
just the result of human thriving, it's a cause. So, for example, fun is energizing. When people tell me their stories
about fun, they glow. It is like a fire has been lit
inside of them, and the energy and the warmth
that they give off is contagious. You know, so much of life drains us, but fun fills us up. Fun also makes us present. A lot of us put a lot of work
into trying to be more present -- we do yoga classes, we meditate,
and that is all great, but the fact that fun is a flow state
means that when we are having fun, we simply are present. There's no other way for it to happen. Fun also unites us. We live in a really polarized world, and as we all know,
there's a lot of very serious problems. But when we have fun with people, we don't see them
as different political parties, or nationalities or religions. We connect with them as human beings, and it's worth noting
that that is the first step in being able to work together
to solve those problems. Fun also makes us healthier. Being lonely and stressed out, as many of us have been
for the past two years, causes hormonal changes in our bodies
that increase our risks for disease. But when we have fun, we're relaxed and we're more
socially connected, both of which have the opposite effect. So, kind of blows my mind every time
I think about it this way, but having fun is a health intervention. And then, lastly, fun is joyful. You know, we all so desperately
want to be happy. We read books about happiness, we download apps about happiness, but when we are in a moment
of having fun, we are happy. So it makes me think that, perhaps, the secret to long-term happiness is just to have more
everyday moments of fun. So how do we do that? How do we have more fun? Well, to start with, do not take the suggestions
you'll find in magazine articles about how to have more fun. I looked at some of these myself, and I found suggestions that include --
and I'm not making these up -- ""roast a turkey."" (Laughter) ""Put together an altar
to loved ones who have passed."" (Laughter) “Watch a documentary
about climate change.” (Laughter) And my personal favorite, ""Adorn your table with gourds."" (Laughter) Those are not good suggestions. Instead, the most effective thing
you can do to have more fun is to focus on its ingredients,
by which I mean, do everything you can to fill your life
with more moments of playfulness, connection and flow. So here are some ideas for how to do so. To start with, reduce distractions
in order to increase flow. Anything that distracts you
is going to kick you out of flow and prevent you from having fun. And what's the number one
source of distraction for most of us, these days? Oh, thank you. (Laughs) It was rhetorical, but yes, your phones. (Laughs) I wrote a book called
""How to Break Up With Your Phone,"" so I have strong feelings about this, but I can guarantee you
that you are not going to have fun if you're constantly on your phone. So today, I want to challenge you
to keep your phone out of your hand as much as possible, so you can take me up
on my second suggestion, which is to increase connection by interacting more
with other human beings in real life. Now, I know that one of the main reasons
we're constantly on our phones is specifically to avoid
having to spend time and interact with other
human beings in real life. (Laughter) So I want to assure you
that it is worth it, and it is not as hard as it might seem. So here's how you do it. You start by making
eye contact with someone. Like, look them in the eye, don't look in the middle
of their forehead, where the camera would be on a Zoom call. (Laughter) And you say “Hello.” And if that goes well,
you can introduce yourself. And if that goes well, maybe you can ask them a question,
something that's thought-provoking, but not overly personal or threatening, like ""What's something
that fascinates you?"" Or ""What's one thing
that delighted you today?"" And you might be amazed by how good
just one little moment of connection can make you feel. And if you do find someone
to connect with, maybe ask them to join you
in trying my third suggestion, which is to increase playfulness
by finding opportunities to rebel. Now I am not talking about
James Dean-level of rebellion. I'm talking about playful deviance. I'm talking about finding ways
to break the rules of responsible adulthood, and giving yourself permission
to get a kick out of your own life. One person told me that some of the most fun
she'd had in recent memory, happened on a Friday morning, when she and some of her friends
ditched their work and their childcare responsibilities, tucked flasks into their purses and snuck out to a 10:30am showing
of the movie ""Bad Moms."" (Laughter) So lastly, here's one more thing
that you can do today to start having more fun. [Roast a Turkey]
I am just kidding. (Laughter) Prioritize it. That might sound totally obvious, but one of the main reasons
we're not having enough fun is that we're not making it a priority. Our fun is always
at the bottom of the list, and it can't speak up for itself. So I'm not suggesting that you take out
your calendar and make an entry that says: “From 4 to 6pm
on Saturday, I shall have fun.” That is a guaranteed way to not have fun. But if you know you consistently have fun when you spend time
with a particular person, make a point to spend time
with that person. If you know there's an activity that really does often generate
playful connected flow for you, carve out time for it in your schedule. Treat fun as if it is important. Because it is. I've been doing this myself
for a couple of years now, and it's amazing to see how many areas
of my life fun has touched. I'm more creative and more productive,
I'm more resilient. I laugh more. Making sure that I'm having enough fun
has made me a better partner, a better parent and a better friend. And it has convinced me of something that I very much hope
I can convince you of as well, which is that my daughter was right. Fun is sunshine. It's a distillation of life's energy. And the more often we experience it, the more we will feel
like we're actually alive. Thank you. (Cheers and applause)",2022-07-21T16:08:30Z
How Ethics Can Help You Make Better Decisions,Michael Schur,338501,6781,200,What would Immanuel Kant say about a fender bender? In a surprisingly funny trip through the teachings of some of history's great ...,"I've been a television comedy writer
for almost 25 years. I have written sketches and animated shows and sitcoms, but for the last decade, my real passion has been
the study of ethics. It's a classic cautionary tale, right? You move to Hollywood, you get seduced by the bright lights
and the fast cars, and before you know it, you're reading 18-century
German philosophy. (Laughter) I've always been an intense rule follower. When I was in kindergarten, our teacher would tell
everyone to line up, and I would immediately line up and then I would look
at all the other kids who were still goofing off, and I would think, ""What are they doing? Did they not hear her,
she said to line up."" I rinsed my mouth with mouthwash
for at least 30 seconds every night, because on the label, it says
""Use for 30 seconds."" I know, I'm irritated by me, too. (Laughter) But the real reason
that I became interested in ethics is because in 2005, I royally and epically
screwed something up. So, 2005, my wife JJ, driving along in slow-moving traffic
bumps into the guy in front of her. Police officer looks everything over,
doesn't see any damage, they exchange numbers
and they go on their way. A couple days later, we get a notice that the guy
wants 836 dollars because, according to him,
the entire fender needs to be replaced. This is happening
during Hurricane Katrina. JJ and I had just been
to New Orleans on a trip, we had really fallen in love
with this beautiful city, which was now literally under water. I was very riled up. This was hitting me really hard. So I went and I looked at the guy's car, and if I got very close, and I strained my eyes, I could just barely see
this little line on the crease. It looked like the mark you make
with a pencil on the wall when you're trying to hang a picture. And I told the guy, essentially,
that he shouldn't care about this. I told him that things like this were why car insurance rates in LA
were so expensive. I told him that cars get
little dings and dents all the time, and he was stupid to care about that. I told him that there were
more important things in life than this, like Hurricane Katrina. And then I made him an offer. I said that I would donate 836 dollars
to the Red Cross Katrina relief fund in his name, if he agreed not to file
this claim and fix his car. He said he would think it over. So I went back to work, and as very confident people want to do, I started telling all my friends
about how awesome I was being. (Laughter) And then they jumped in and started pledging more and more money if this guy would agree
not to fix his car. So suddenly, it was 2,000 dollars, then it was 5,000 dollars. In like, a day and a half, I had pledges from hundreds of people,
all across the country, of more than 25,000 dollars if this guy would agree not to file
an insurance claim and fix his car. And by the way, he has no idea
this is happening. He is completely in the dark. I started a blog, where I gave people
hourly updates -- yeah. (Laughter) It's beginning to dawn on you
what a bad idea this is, right? I started a blog, gave people updates, I got media inquires
from news programs, from NPR. I had a dream of rescuing
New Orleans by myself, (Laughter) with nothing more than my computer and a fire hose of self-righteous anger. And then I started to feel
sick to my stomach. And so did JJ, at the exact same moment. We both were suddenly overcome
with this awful feeling that there was something
very bad and wrong about what we were doing, but we could not pinpoint what it was. I just remember thinking, ""Alright, I don't care about cars
getting little dings and dents, but this guy does. Is that wrong somehow? I don't think that's wrong. And also, is this little,
tiny negotiation that we're in really worth all of this fury
and rage and shame that I'm whipping up
and sending in his direction? I don't think it is."" So I did what any rational person
would do in this situation. I started crying, and I hid under my bed. (Laughter) And then, I started reading philosophy. And I started calling
philosophy professors and asking them to talk this out with me. And in the process -- yeah, and they all, by the way, did it, because philosophy professors
love talking about philosophy. The drop of a hat, they will all talk
about philosophy with you. So in the process, I learn all of these incredibly
wonderful theories that the smartest people
who have ever lived have developed over the last 2,500 years that help us make better decisions
and become better people. For example, I learned about Immanuel Kant and the categorical imperative. So Kant says, when we're
about to do something we have to design a rule or a maxim that we could will to be universal. Meaning, we have to imagine, what if everyone did
what we're about to do, what would happen to the world? Would it be OK or would it get
all screwed up? So the maxim I'm designing here
is something like, anytime two people
are in any kind of negotiation, one of them can drag into the negotiation an entirely unrelated global calamity (Laughter) and tell the other person that they shouldn't care
about whatever they care about, because they should care
about that instead. That world would suck, right? Like, your sister borrows
five dollars from you, you ask for it back, she says, ""How dare you care
about five dollars when the polar ice caps are melting?"" No one wants to live in this world, right? Kant also says, by the way, that you should treat people
as ends in themselves, and not a means to an end, meaning, you shouldn't use people
to get what you want. Well, that's what I was doing. I also learned about Aristotle
and the study of virtue ethics. So Aristotle says there's certain
qualities we should all have. Things like generosity and courage and friendliness and mildness, and he wants us to practice them every day so that we not only have them, we have them in the exact right amount. We don't have a deficiency of them, and we don't have an excess of them. Now virtue ethics can be kind of,
maddeningly imprecise, but at the very least, it was pretty clear
that I was exhibiting an excess of anger and maybe a deficiency of friendliness. I wasn't nailing it, is the point. Like, I definitely
was not getting it exactly right. Then I learned about utilitarianism, made famous by Jeremy Bentham
and John Stuart Mill. And this one actually
gave me a shred of hope that I was doing something good, because utilitarians only care
about the results of our actions, they only care that we are creating
more happiness and pleasure than we are pain and suffering. So yes, I'm being obnoxious
and moralistic, and I hand it to this guy,
causing him some amount of pain, but an enormous amount of money is going to be given
to people in great need. So the amount of happiness I’m creating outweighs the amount
of pain and suffering. But the utilitarians also said that when we're calculating
the amount of happiness or pain we've created, we can't just think about the one
person we're dealing with, we have to think about the fact
that everybody in our society will now both know this happened and will fear that it could
someday happen to them. And since we've already seen
what a terrible, stinky world I was trying to create, everyone in our society would become
a little bit bummed out and sad by what I did, and so the total amount
of pain and suffering I've created might actually outweigh the happiness. I never got a straightforward
answer, obviously, because Aristotle never wrote about, like, fender benders
involving horse-drawn carriages in ancient Athens. But at the very least, it sure felt like Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill
would be a little disappointed in me. And it sure felt like Aristotle
would be a little annoyed, and it sure felt like Immanuel Kant
would wave a disapproving finger at me. And if all of the world's
greatest philosophers are on one side of a debate, and you are on the other side ... (Laughter) You fucked up, OK. (Laughter) (Applause) So I called the guy. I apologized profusely, I told him the entire story. He was very kind and forgiving, which was an enormous relief to me. I told him I had already cut him a check,
which was in the mail. I went back to the blog,
I told everybody the outcome. Most people, not all, but most of them, thought it was a pretty happy outcome. I encouraged them to give money
to the Red Cross anyway, because giving money to hurricane victims
is a nice thing to do, and in the end, more than 25,000 dollars
was indeed donated to the Red Cross
Hurricane Katrina relief efforts. Don't applaud that, because that's the happy
result of a bad event. So why did this embarrassing,
miserable mistake that I made make me want to continue
to study moral philosophy? If I told you that you
were going to be on Jeopardy, how would you prepare? You would read some trivia books
and flip through a world atlas. If I told you that you were going
to take a half-court shot at an NBA game for the chance to win 50,000 dollars, how would you prepare? You would get a basketball, you would go to the YMCA and you would practice hucking up
half-court shots. Well, you're probably
never going to be on Jeopardy. You are probably never
going to take a half-court shot at an NBA game for a chance to win 50,000 dollars. But you will, I guarantee it, at some point, become embroiled in a complicated, confusing, ugly,
gut-wrenching moral dilemma. That is just a fact of life on Earth. There will be a dilemma
in which there is no clear rule to follow. There is only a kind of,
vague investigation and everything you do
seems like it might be wrong. So how do you prepare for that? By reading theories of ethics and understanding what they say, what they mean, how they purport to help us
make better decisions and become better people. And by the way, just reading these theories
is no guarantee that you will actually
make the right choice when you're inside
one of these complicated and tangled ethical dilemmas. You can take all the practice
half-court shots you want at the YMCA, but when you set foot
on the floor of the NBA arena, and there are 15,000 screaming fans, you're probably still
going to throw up an air ball, right? But if you've prepared, you will increase your odds of success. You will increase the chances
that you sink the shot or that you at least get the ball
close enough to the rim that you don't embarrass yourself
and become a meme. (Laughter) Understanding ethical theories is how we increase our chances of success
at simply being human beings who have to negotiate
with other human beings. And to me, there is nothing
more important than that. Thank you. (Applause)",2022-07-07T18:22:05Z
The Case for Radically Human Buildings,Thomas Heatherwick,372589,9673,342,Where did all the lumps and bumps on buildings go? When did city architecture become so ... dull? Here to talk about why cities ...,"When was the last time
you walked down the street in a city with new buildings? I want to talk to you about the problem that we all know exists
in our towns and cities. We're increasingly surrounded
by characterless buildings. I believe we're living through
an epidemic of boringness. (Laughter) (Applause) With a few exceptions, we all know that new buildings
will be dead and monotonous. Everywhere is the same. Dull, flat, straight, shiny. Inhuman. They're what my daughter
calls ""meh"" buildings. These buildings justify themselves
as being functional. I’m a designer of buildings,
and I’ve been told so many times that form should follow function. Meaning if I work out mechanically
how a building goes together well, the outcome will somehow
inevitably look good. This mantra, form follows function,
is a century old. And it sounds good, doesn't it? Who can argue with that? Surely any extra detail is just silly,
unnecessary decoration. I want to talk about the function that's crucial that I believe is missing. The function of emotion. And when I say emotion, I mean the ability of buildings
to mean something to us. To lift our spirits, to connect us. Buildings affect us. We walk around them, we look up at them. And for most of us,
for the vast majority of the time, they just leave us feeling indifferent. So if I took all of us to a city and said, ""Which bit would you like to go to? Would you like to go to the old bit or the new bit?"" (Laughter) You've given me my answer already. We all know instinctively, the majority are going
to pick the old bit. Why? Because we all know the new bit
will be characterless and boring. So where did all the lumps
and bumps on buildings go? The shadows, the textures,
the three-dimensionality, the high points of light. How did it all become so two dimensional, so simplistic and devoid of character? Well, it turns out, I'm not the only one who's alarmed by what's happening
in our towns and cities. There's research showing that these buildings
aren't just simplistic and monotonous. They're harming us. They're bad for our mental health, causing stress in our brains
as we walk around them. They're bad for our physical health, making us take longer to recover
from illness inside them. And they're also bad for societal health, increasing the likelihood of crime
and anti-social behavior. But this gets most sinister
when we step back and think about the climate crisis
unfolding around us. Immense emphasis has been placed
on the impact of cars and aviation. And in this 2019 study, aviation was responsible for 2.1 percent
of greenhouse gas emissions. But the crazy elephant in the room is that the construction
industry as a whole is responsible for a whopping 38 percent. And in America every year, a billion square foot of buildings
are destroyed and rebuilt. That’s the equivalent of half
of Washington, DC being deconstructed just to be reconstructed. And this isn't just in the US. This is global. In the UK, we demolish
50,000 buildings a year. The average age of a commercial building
in the UK is 40 years. So that means if I had been born
as a commercial building, I would have been killed 12 years ago. (Laughter) It's quite straightforward. When people don't love -- and I'm using the word love -- love buildings, they're more likely to demolish them. I feel those two dots
haven't been connected together. But when you make a building, one of the most expensive things
you can possibly do, there are understandably huge
pressures of cost of time, of politics and egos
and regulations and the status quo. These forces of soullessness are immense. And change is scary for everybody, myself included. But I'm convinced that emotion
is the crucial function that's been forgotten. There are, however,
a tiny handful of people who do understand
and are trying to address this. Here's a few of them. In France, Sou Fujimoto has designed this
amazingly textured apartment building. In Burkina Faso, Francis Kéré has made
this soulful health center. In Lebanon, Lina Ghotmeh Architecture
has been using splendidly thick walls to make characterful housing. And in the UK, ACME Studio have been bringing
personality and detail to city center buildings. I thought I'd now show you a few examples of ways my own studio
has been trying to address this too. In Cape Town, there was a huge century-old
disused grain silo that was once used for storing maize
from throughout South Africa that was at significant risk
of being demolished. We proposed to not knock it down, but instead turned it into Africa's
first major institution for contemporary African artists. (Applause) You haven't seen it yet. (Laughter) We took one of the original grain -- You might get disappointed now. (Laughter) We took one of the original grains of corn that had been stored
in the original building. And we cut it out
of the heart of that building. And around that put 80 galleries. And most of our work was about restoring
and reinvigorating a historical structure. But central part of our vision
was using our limited budget to create the most
compelling heart possible with those gigantic tubes. (Applause) And the key thing was how we could make people
not just stand at the outside and admire a structure, but how we could pull them into the inside where curiosity would then
do the rest of the work. And you enter under the grain hoppers where the grain used to drop
onto the conveyor belts. And we loved that by cutting
through the original, historic, extraordinary structure, we could expose and share
the building's idiosyncrasies. And like these nooks and crannies, they help to give
the project its soulfulness. And on the top is a sculpture garden
with a glass floor. And if you see those babies
on the glass just there, this is their view. The finished museum is raw, it's rough, but it's true. And it was an honor to bring
this historic structure back into life. In Singapore, we searched for solutions for why would people be excited
to learn in universities anymore? In this new digital era where you can do
virtually everything online, and you can even get a PhD
lying in bed, I've heard, why do we need university
buildings anymore? Well, we believe they're where you come
together to have ideas, to meet your future business partner or the person you're going to set up
a not-for-profit with. Yet this has been the typical experience. Polystyrene ceiling tiles,
no natural daylight, the least inspiring place to meet people. So to counter that, we made a corridor-less
university building where the students can all see each other. A building which has no front
and has no back. And it's not one building,
it's actually 12 buildings. Our goal was to invent a new kind
of tropical architecture that used the minimum possible energy, where you learn in corner-less classrooms. Where those professors
and teachers work with you rather than dictating to you. Where people can be inspired by learning but encouraged to linger. And it's open 24 hours. And when I was last in Singapore, I had jet lag and it was
two o'clock in the morning. And so I went along and there were students there
just quietly working and connecting. In Yorkshire, in the UK, we had the chance to humanize
a treatment building at one of the UK's largest
cancer hospitals. So when you think of the worst building
environments you've ever been to, surely hospitals
are at the top of that list. They're some of the most stress
and fear-inducing places you can possibly be in. So we set ourselves the mission to make a non-clinical building
where you could feel vulnerable. And cry and feel protected and come together as a community. But our site was on the last bit
of greenery at the hospital. And we didn't want to be the ones
who dropped a big box and wiped out all that greenery. So we wondered instead, could we amplify the greenery
that we knew could help with healing? So just like those dinosaur models
made from plywood that slot together, we slotted together giant plywood to make three structures to hold up three major gardens
and make a garden building. This building has 17,000 plants, 23,000 bulbs, and actually a 436 percent
biodiversity increase on that site. (Applause) Our goal was to really make somewhere
where people could come together and where by focusing
on the emotion of the users to really try to make
an architecture of hope. Finally, in Shanghai, we had the chance
that's typical of our time. The challenge of bigness. To make a three and a half million
square-foot site, a building project on a site
that was 480 meters long. Where typically
this is what would be built. The site was so big that the Empire State Building
could fit on it lying sideways. So to make this cost efficient, structurally effective, we needed 1,000 columns on a grid, so we decided to not just decorate boxes, but to let the columns be our heroes and to connect with the park to one side and the art district on the other side and try to bring them together into one. The finished project is called
“A Thousand Trees.” (Applause) Every one of those columns
has a Chinese mountain tree, semi-mature mountain tree on top. And nourishment and drainage
and lighting and moisture, and because every column
is the best place to put a heavy load. And it has hundreds of outdoor terraces and it has shading and it has, we hope,
the necessary complexity to create the human engagement
in a project at such a scale. We also worked with local artists to embed their work into our vision, to really make a collaborative
project together. And that carries through
all the way to the inside. And this project opened
at the end of last year, the first half of it. And we have 100,000
people going to it every day. And it wasn't just about trees and plants, but even structural columns
were our friends to humanize the project at such a scale. So I'm not saying that there's any one language or approach to deal with this epidemic of boring. Just like in nature, we've learned the vast
importance of biodiversity, we now desperately need
architectural diversity. (Applause) My goal is to try to help trigger a global humanizing movement that no longer tolerates
soulless, inhuman places. What if our buildings inspired us to want to adapt and adjust
and repair them? We can't keep knocking down
the buildings around us all the time. Let’s stop building 40-year buildings, and let's build a 1,000-year buildings. Please join me. Thank you. (Applause and cheers)",2022-07-06T16:35:44Z
The Actual Cost of Preventing Climate Breakdown,Yuval Noah Harari,215309,8218,741,Nobody really knows how much it would cost to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Yet historian Yuval Noah Harari's ...,"As the climate crisis worsens, too many people are swinging
from denial straight to despair. But we should not lose hope. Humanity has enormous resources
under its command, and by applying them wisely, we can still prevent ecological cataclysm. Let's talk numbers. What would it cost to prevent
catastrophic climate change? Would we have to commit
50 percent of our total budget? Thirty percent? Ten percent? Naturally enough, no one knows for sure. My team and I have spent weeks
poring over various reports and academic papers
living in a cloud of numbers. But while the models behind the numbers
are dizzyingly complex, the bottom line should cheer us up. Most experts converge
on the number two percent. If humanity increases our annual
investment in clean technologies and infrastructure by around
two percent of global GDP, that should be enough to prevent
catastrophic climate change. If you want to see how experts
got to that number, you're welcome to visit
the Sapienship website. We can, of course, argue endlessly
about the exact number, tweaking the models this way and that way. But we should look at the big picture. The crucial news is that the price tag
of preventing the apocalypse is in the low single digits
of annual global GDP. Even the more pessimistic models generally estimate it
at below five percent. And most models say it requires investing only an additional two percent
of global GDP in the right places. And note the word investing. We are not talking
about burning piles of banknotes in some huge sacrifice
to the spirits of the Earth. We are talking about making investments in new technologies and infrastructure, such as advanced batteries
or other technologies to store solar energy and updated power grids to distribute it. These investments will create lots
of new jobs and economic opportunities and are likely to be economically
profitable in the long run, in part by reducing
health care expenditures and saving millions of people
from sickness caused by air pollution. In addition, since oil and gas often prop
up autocratic and militaristic regimes, reducing our dependence on fossil fuels will be a huge boon
to democracy and to peace. All this can be translated
into a concrete political plan of action. We have learned in recent years
to define our goal in terms of one number: 1.5 degrees Celsius. We can define the means to do this with another number: two percent. Increased investment in clean
technologies and infrastructure by two percentage points of global GDP, above 2020 levels. Of course, unlike the 1.5 Celsius figure, which is a scientifically
robust threshold, the two-percent figure represents
only a rough guesstimate. It should be understood
as a ballpark figure that can help to frame the kind of political project
humanity requires. It tells us that preventing
catastrophic climate change is a totally feasible project, even though it would obviously
cost a lot of money. Since global GDP in 2020
was about 85 trillion US dollars, we are talking about a number
around 1.7 trillion US dollars. But that's still just two percent. This means that to save the environment, we don't need to completely
derail the economy or to abandon the achievements
of modern civilization. We just need to get our priorities right. Committing two percent
of annual global GDP is far from the whole story, of course. It won't solve all
our ecological problems, such as oceans brimming with plastic
or the continued loss of biodiversity. And even to prevent
catastrophic climate change we'll need to make sure that the funds
are invested in the right places and that the new investments don't cause their own negative
ecological or social fallout. We will also need to change
some of our behaviors and ways of thinking from what we eat to how we travel. None of that will be easy. But that's exactly
why we have politicians. Their job is to deal with the hard stuff. And politicians are actually very skilled
at shifting two percent of resources from here to there. It's what they do all the time. The difference between
the policies of right wing and left wing parties often amounts to a few
percentage points of GDP. When faced by a major crisis, politicians swiftly shift
far more resources to fight it. For example, in 1945, the US spent about 36 percent of its GDP on winning the Second World War. During the 2008-2009 financial crisis, the US government spent
about 3.5 percent of GDP to save financial institutions
that were deemed ""too big to fail."" Maybe humankind should also treat
the Amazon rainforest as too big to fail. Let's try a thought experiment. Given the current price of cleared
rainforest land in South America and the size of the Amazon rainforest, buying the [whole] of it in order
to protect local forests, biodiversity and human communities
from destructive business interests would cost about 800 billion dollars, or a one-off payment
of less than one percent of global GDP. In just the first nine months of 2020, governments around the world
announced stimulus measures worth nearly 14 percent of global GDP to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic. If citizens pressed them hard enough, politicians can do the same
to deal with the ecological crisis. So can investment banks and pension funds. Pension funds hold
over 56 trillion US dollars. What's the point of having a pension
if you don't have a future? At present, most businesses and governments
are unwilling to make the additional two-percent investment necessary to prevent
catastrophic climate change. Where does that money go instead? Well, every two years, approximately 2.4 percent of global GDP is spent on food that goes to waste. Governments also spend
about 500 billion US dollars annually on -- wait for it -- direct subsidies for fossil fuels. That means that every 3.5 years
governments write a nice fat check for an amount equivalent to two percent
of annual global GDP and gift it to the fossil fuel industry. And it gets worse when you factor in
the social and environmental costs that the fossil fuel industry causes but isn't asked to pay for, the value of these subsidies actually reaches a staggering
seven percent of annual global GDP. Now consider tax evasion. It's estimated that the money hidden
by the wealthy in tax havens is worth around 10 percent of global GDP. Every year, another 1.4 trillion dollars in profits is stashed offshore by corporations, which is equal to 1.6 percent
of global GDP. To prevent the apocalypse, we'll probably need to impose
some new taxes. But why not start
with collecting the old ones? Such examples can be multiplied. But you get the picture. The money is there. Of course, collecting taxes, stopping food wastage
and slashing subsidies is easier said than done, especially when faced by some
of the most powerful lobbies in the world. But it doesn't require a miracle. It just requires determined organization. So we shouldn't succumb to defeatism. Whenever someone says, ""It's too late, the apocalypse is here,"" reply, ""Nah, we can stop it
with just two percent."" And when COP 27 convenes
in Egypt in November 2022, we should tell the attending leaders that it's not enough to make
vague future pledges about 1.5 degrees Celsius. We want them to take out their pens and sign a check for two percent of annual global GDP. Thank you.",2022-06-17T15:47:08Z
A Brain Implant That Turns Your Thoughts Into Text,Tom Oxley,202120,5967,465,What if you could control digital devices using just the power of thought? That's the incredible promise behind the Stentrode -- an ...,"A few months ago, I surrendered the password
to my Twitter account to let a person with paralysis
tweet out their thoughts. But I mean that literally. Philip O'Keefe can't use
his fingers to type like you or I, but thanks to a tiny brain implant, he was able to send the following tweets. ""Hello world! Short tweet.
Monumental progress."" ""No need for keystrokes or voices. I created this tweet just by thinking it."" ""My hope is that I pave the way for people to be able to tweet
through thoughts. Phil."" Now you might be thinking
there are some people out there who should not be allowed
to tweet directly from their brain. (Laughter) I agree. But for people with paralysis
and disability, this technology can be life-changing. I’m very excited to introduce you
to Philip and Rodney. They both have a neurodegenerative
disease called ALS, means they can't move
their hands or speak clearly, but they can now text thanks to a brain-computer
interface or BCI. There were Philip’s brain signals
up on the screen. They’re connected
to their computers via Bluetooth. The device is fully internalized,
invisible to the outside world, and they learn to control the keyboard with clicks directly coming
from their brain. Now BCIs conjure up images
of science fiction like ""The Matrix"" with a cable jacked up into your brain
through a hole in your skull. But I'm here to show you that the future
can be much more elegant than that. So we got this group chat going, which I thought was a great idea, until they started roasting me
about the TED Talk -- (Laughter) Which they found hilarious. Thanks for the vote of confidence, guys, bloody Australians. (Laughter) Now you can see it's still quite slow
for them to type this way, but this is like dial up speeds
at the beginning of the Internet. This is a new Moore's Law. We're just getting started. (Laughter) (Applause) That's Philip. This has been the dream
of patients and caregivers, doctors and scientists, for decades, and for good reason. You may know someone who's lost
the ability to use their hands, maybe from a stroke
or a spinal cord injury or multiple sclerosis, paralysis. It comes in all shapes and sizes, from minor inconvenience
to life-threatening. During my neurology residency,
I cared for a man in his 40s. He had a stroke and developed
locked-in syndrome. Meant he couldn't move his body,
except for his eyes, left or right. His brain still worked like yours. He could see and hear and think
and feel just like normal, but he couldn't move or speak ever again. And in what were horrific circumstances, we supported his wish
to be taken off life support. And so I've been wondering ever since, was there not anything else
that could have been done? Connection is a fundamental human need. So many of our patients have lost
the ability to speak, let alone type, for years, and they so desperately want
to reconnect with their family, with their loved ones. You know what the main request we get is? Text messaging. And then email. Control over their smartphone. And shock horror, social media. We've been speaking so much lately
about the flaws of these technologies, but for people with paralysis,
this is a return to life. BCIs make all of this possible. Now, part of the problem has been that BCIs typically require
invasive surgery. This is the Utah Array. This is designed similarly
to all other BCIs currently under development, which require drilling needles
directly into the brain. Now, this has been the basis
of critical fundamental research over the last 20 years and the early proof that this
technology really can perform. But for patients,
it means open-brain surgery, which involves cutting through
the skull with a saw. And there are only about 150
functional neurosurgeons in the US that can perform this procedure. Apart from the fact
that the recovery is tricky, the brain doesn't really like
having needles put into it. It develops this foreign-body tissue
rejection immune reaction over time. So I've been wondering,
is there any other way into the brain? And there is, a secret back door. The blood vessels are the natural
highways into the brain. These are hollow tubes that connect
every corner of the brain. The largest vein at the top there
is right next to the motor cortex. The exact part of the brain
that we want to connect to to restore control to the outside world. How cool is that? Now we already know how to travel
through the blood vessels. We've been doing it for 40 years,
mostly going to the heart. If anyone here today
has had a heart attack, there's a pretty good chance
you've had a stent. A stent is a metal scaffold
delivered through a catheter, which opens up like a flower
into the blood vessel. Millions of stents
are delivered each year, not in the OR, but in the cath lab
or catheter laboratory. It's now common in the cath lab
to navigate up into the brain through the blood vessels. And there are 2,500 physicians who can now navigate their way
up into the brain. But what's really amazing about this is that for BCIs we already know that devices can be left
inside a blood vessel, cells grow over it,
incorporate it into the wall like a tattoo under the skin, and we're protected
from that immune reaction. This is part of the reason why our team
became the first in the world to receive a green light from the FDA
to conduct clinical trials of a permanently implanted BCI. (Applause) So what we had to do
was figure out a way to put a sensor, connected to this crosslinks of the stent that could record that brain activity. To do that, we had to do a complete
overhaul of stent manufacturing. This is the end result. I think it's very beautiful. Then connect it to a cable which brings the information
out of the brain and do it all in a way
that it can be delivered in the cath lab. This way we can make BCI accessible
not to the thousands of people, but to the millions of people
who need this technology. So it wasn't easy, took us ten years, but I'm very excited to show you guys. We called this the Stentrode. (Applause) Graham Felstead, an incredible
human being suffering with ALS, became the first person in the world to receive and use one of these
brain-computer interfaces. And he has very generously
offered you, the world, a chance to see what it looks like
inside his brain. Would you like to see? Audience: Yes! TO: Seeing this video for the first time was one of the most incredible
moments of my life. I was standing in the cath lab, Dr. Peter Mitchell had just
completed the surgery and you can see the device,
the outline of device, sitting inside the blood vessel there. So this popped up on the screen and it just felt like we were witnessing
something new in the world. I had tingles down my spine, I've got them now thinking about it again. I turned to my colleague Pete, and I said something poetic
and profound like, ""Pete, holy shit!"" (Laughter) And then two hours later,
something even more amazing happened. Graham woke up,
and he asked, “Am I alive?” And our nurse Kristine
broke out in tears of relief. It was a phenomenal moment. Once it's in place, it's connected to this tiny antenna
that sits under the skin in the chest. This collects the raw brain data and sends it out of the body wirelessly to then connect with external devices. It's always on and ready to go. Kind of like how your brain
is meant to work. So here's how it works. Our engineers work with our patients
to decode specific movements. So we tell the patient,
“Press down your foot.” So they'll repeatedly
press down their foot. You won't see the foot moving
because they're paralyzed, but we've been able to determine which brain signals are generally linked
to “Press down your foot.” The black dotted line is the moment
of pressing down the foot, and you can see the brain signal
is different before to after, which means we can turn
that into a switch. Now we repeat this for several
different types of movements, say, open/close your hand
or pincer-grip your finger. Now, that may not seem like much, but these become the building blocks
for every single interaction on a digital device
that is needed for control. Converted to click, up, down, left, right,
menu, back, etc. But what's really amazing
is that to some degree, this process, our brain signals, are universal. So the brain signal
for “Press down your foot” for me is the same as it is for you. Now this means that we're creating
a dictionary of the brain across all humans. This is going to make BCI truly scalable. As Philip once said to me, ""It's kind of like learning
how to ride a bike. It takes a bit of practice,
but once you're rolling, it becomes natural. Now I just look on the screen
where I want to click and I'm texting, messaging the world via Twitter."" But Graham, he said, as his ALS was progressing, that it gave him immense comfort
to know that even if his body was failing, he was always going to be able
to tell his wife that he loved her. In the future, I'm really excited about the breakthroughs
BCI could deliver to other conditions like epilepsy, depression and dementia. But beyond that, what is this going to mean for humanity? What's really got me thinking
is the future of communication. Take emotion. Have you ever considered
how hard it is to express how you feel? You have to self-reflect, package the emotion into words and then use the muscles of your mouth
to speak those words. But you really just want
someone to know how you feel. For some people with certain conditions, that's impossible. So what if, rather than using your words, you could throw your emotion
just for a few seconds? And have them really feel how you feel. At that moment, we would have realized that the necessary use of words
to express our current state of being was always going to fall short. The full potential of the brain
would then be unlocked. But for right now, BCI is about restoring the lives
of millions of people with paralysis. After years of feeling trapped, this technology promises the return
of autonomy and independence. But what I really mean is dignity. Thank you. (Applause)",2022-06-02T11:58:28Z
The Case for a 4-Day Work Week,Juliet Schor,227663,5792,453,"The traditional approach to work needs a redesign, says economist Juliet Schor. She's leading four-day work week trials in ...","I've been studying work since the 1980s, and I've never seen anything
like what's happening today. Pandemic-fueled anxiety
is surging around the world. In the US, more than half
of all employees report feeling stressed a lot of the day. Job quits are at record levels,
running at four million a month. People are burning out. In response, a growing number of companies
are offering a four-day, 32-hour week, but with five days of pay. Now, it's not a new idea, but the pandemic has turbocharged it. Employers are realizing that if they can rethink
where people work, they can also rethink
how many days they're on the job. Sounds pretty great, but is it realistic? Well, actually, yes. Unlike policies in which one party
profits at the expense of another, the four-day week can benefit workers,
companies and society, and it can even be a gateway
for addressing climate change. But first, let's talk about the workplace. For nearly a decade, companies and governments
have been experimenting with shorter hours with no cuts in pay. While the results do vary, the research shows
that people are less stressed, value their jobs more and have better lives outside of work. In most cases, they are as productive
in four days as they are in five. Companies can also see benefits
through lower turnover and a higher-quality applicant pool. Less burnout reduces health care costs,
mistakes and poor service. With colleagues, I'm studying four-day week trials
now in progress in the United States and Ireland, with summer start dates for the UK,
New Zealand and Australia. We have thousands
of employees participating. Healthwise, an education company,
didn't wait for our trial to begin. In June, their employees
were quitting in droves. By August, they'd implemented
a four-day week. Six months later, CEO Adam Husney reports
that people are dramatically happier and have never been more productive. Resignations and sick days are down, revenue has grown and customer satisfaction
scores are outstanding. Healthwise employees
are spending their Fridays off doing family activities
like sports or errands. One mother of young children reported
that now she can occasionally manage a guilt-free pedicure. The four-day week can help with self-care and managing the daily stresses
of systemic racism, sexism and classism. Now a key part of the model is that in return
for the gift of a day off, people are willing to squeeze
all their productivity into four days. So while they may be spending
less time at work, they're not necessarily doing less work. The secret sauce is work reorganization, cutting out the least
productive activities. Meetings are a prime target. Yes, I see everyone nodding. Most companies reduce
their frequency and length and the number of attendees. At Healthwise, people save time by messaging colleagues
rather than making phone calls, which inevitably includes
some social chatting. They shifted personal tasks,
like doctor's appointments, to the off-day. And yes, the pace of work
at the office does go up. ""Let's be honest,"" one explained, ""I'm not goofing off
or looking at Facebook, which I was."" But people have adapted and they prefer getting their downtime
as a whole day off rather than in snippets. Government initiatives
have similar findings. In 2015, the city of Reykjavik and then the National
Government of Iceland started offering 36 and 35-hour weeks, eventually enrolling
more than 2,500 employees. The results have been remarkable. Physical and mental stress went down while work ethic, job satisfaction, work-life balance,
energy levels, all improved. Productivity and service quality
stayed the same or got better, and the trial was revenue-neutral. Today, roughly 85 percent
of all Icelandic employees are either on or eligible
for these schedules. The governments of Spain and Scotland
have announced four-day week trials in which they'll be subsidizing
the fifth day's pay. Now one reason for these successes is that with reduced work time, each hour typically becomes
more productive. Norway and Denmark, the two European countries
with the shortest average hours of work at about 1,380, have outsized productivity. France and Germany are similar. In contrast, the long-hours countries
like the UK and Italy have much, much lower productivity. The US historically
led the world in productivity and would likely do better now
if its work time weren't so high. While tech firms comprise
the biggest group adopting four-day reduced hours schedules, companies are also
making the switch in banking, PR, marketing and design, nonprofits, consumer goods,
even a restaurant chain. But it's also true that doing 100 percent of the work
in 80 percent of the time isn't feasible everywhere. Manufacturing was sped up decades ago. Many teachers and flight attendants
need to slow down, not intensify. And of course, health care workers
on the front lines of the pandemic need to work less, not more. (Applause) Thank you, health care workers. Here, another government
effort is instructive. In 2014, the city of Gothenburg in Sweden gave nurses at one
of its facilities a six-hour day. As expected, the nurses' health
and overall well-being improved, as did productivity and patient care. But in this trial, they hired new staff for the hours
that weren't being covered. The striking finding was
how much lower sick pay and unemployment benefits helped offset
those additional salaries. Now the Swedish case raises a bigger,
more existential question. How much time should we
be dedicating to work? In many countries, jobs are getting more, not less demanding. And scarcity thinking, the idea that even rich countries
need to tighten their belts, has taken hold. But really, we should be heading
in the opposite direction as digitization
and artificial intelligence offer the chance to reduce work time. Amid pandemic fatigue, we should be doubling down on restoring
the quality of life and our social fabric, especially in wealthy countries
where we already produce enough for everyone to have a good
standard of living. And this path has the added benefit
of addressing the climate crisis. ""How so,"" you may ask. Well, with the four-day week, there's the obvious impact
of less commuting. But if we use productivity growth
to continue to reduce hours of work just by a couple of percent a year, we can create a longer-term
dynamic of decarbonization. Research by me and others
has shown this time and again across countries, across states,
across households. One reason is that when people
are time-stressed, they tend to choose faster
and more polluting modes of travel and daily life activities. In contrast, when people get time rather than money, they tend to have a lower
carbon footprint. But the bigger reason has to do
with the size of the economy. By opting to work less, countries are choosing
not to expand production to its max, thereby avoiding additional emissions. Carbon success stories
like Germany and Denmark tend to have low annual hours. France and the Netherlands are also low
on both carbon and work time. The four-day week is a down payment
on a new way to live and work. And yes, we're going to need
government help if we're going to move beyond
the innovative companies that already see its virtues. But as the three-day weekend spreads, we can realize everyone deserves
a right to free time. And that brings the logic of a universal
basic income squarely into view. Because without financial support, low-earners can't afford
to take that fifth day off. There's a lot of talk these days
about the future of work and the opportunities that it offers. But there's more at stake
here than opportunity. We have an imperative. An imperative to face the challenges
of our current moment. The pandemic, burnout and depression, inequalities of race and income, the climate crisis. A four-day week
addresses each one of these. For now, we're starting
company by company. But as momentum builds
and it becomes universal, we'll have made the transition
from scarcity thinking to appreciating the true wealth
that we possess. Our ingenuity, our compassion and our humanity. Thank you. (Applause) Helen Walters: Juliet, thank you so much. I have a very practical question for you. So you mentioned in the talk
that people were taking Friday off. Is the recommendation that people
all take the same day off, or is this something that people can take,
kind of, any day they want off? What's the ideal mechanism
to have in place here? JS: Every company does it
the way that works for them. And that's one of the things in our trial. We do coaching, and we work
with the companies before they start to figure out are they a company
that can shut down for one day? Do they need to have 24/7, you know,
customer service available? So really, it depends,
and we're seeing every type. HW: Juliet, thank you so much. (Applause)",2022-05-27T11:00:29Z
Elon Musk: A future worth getting excited about,Tesla Texas Gigafactory interview,10192064,183596,15955,"What's on Elon Musk's mind? In this exclusive conversation with head of TED Chris Anderson, Musk details how the radical new ...","Chris Anderson: Elon Musk,
great to see you. How are you? Elon Musk: Good. How are you? CA: We're here at the Texas Gigafactory
the day before this thing opens. It's been pretty crazy out there. Thank you so much
for making time on a busy day. I would love you to help us,
kind of, cast our minds, I don't know, 10, 20,
30 years into the future. And help us try to picture
what it would take to build a future that's worth
getting excited about. The last time you spoke at TED, you said that that was really
just a big driver. You know, you can talk about lots of other
reasons to do the work you're doing, but fundamentally, you want
to think about the future and not think that it sucks. EM: Yeah, absolutely. I think in general, you know, there's a lot of discussion of like,
this problem or that problem. And a lot of people are sad
about the future and they're ... Pessimistic. And I think ... this is ... This is not great. I mean, we really want
to wake up in the morning and look forward to the future. We want to be excited
about what's going to happen. And life cannot simply be about sort of, solving one miserable
problem after another. CA: So if you look forward 30 years,
you know, the year 2050 has been labeled by scientists as this, kind of, almost like this
doomsday deadline on climate. There's a consensus of scientists,
a large consensus of scientists, who believe that if we haven't
completely eliminated greenhouse gases or offset them completely by 2050, effectively we're inviting
climate catastrophe. Do you believe there is a pathway
to avoid that catastrophe? And what would it look like? EM: Yeah, so I am not one
of the doomsday people, which may surprise you. I actually think we're on a good path. But at the same time, I want to caution against complacency. So, so long as we are not complacent, as long as we have a high sense of urgency about moving towards
a sustainable energy economy, then I think things will be fine. So I can't emphasize that enough, as long as we push hard
and are not complacent, the future is going to be great. Don't worry about it. I mean, worry about it, but if you worry about it, ironically,
it will be a self-unfulfilling prophecy. So, like, there are three elements
to a sustainable energy future. One is of sustainable energy generation,
which is primarily wind and solar. There's also hydro, geothermal, I'm actually pro-nuclear. I think nuclear is fine. But it's going to be primarily
solar and wind, as the primary generators of energy. The second part is you need batteries
to store the solar and wind energy because the sun
doesn't shine all the time, the wind doesn't blow all the time. So it's a lot of stationary battery packs. And then you need electric transport. So electric cars, electric planes, boats. And then ultimately, it’s not really possible
to make electric rockets, but you can make
the propellant used in rockets using sustainable energy. So ultimately, we can have a fully
sustainable energy economy. And it's those three things: solar/wind, stationary
battery pack, electric vehicles. So then what are the limiting
factors on progress? The limiting factor really will be
battery cell production. So that's going to really be
the fundamental rate driver. And then whatever the slowest element of the whole lithium-ion
battery cells supply chain, from mining and the many steps of refining to ultimately creating a battery cell and putting it into a pack, that will be the limiting factor
on progress towards sustainability. CA: All right, so we need to talk
more about batteries, because the key thing
that I want to understand, like, there seems to be
a scaling issue here that is kind of amazing and alarming. You have said that you have calculated that the amount of battery production
that the world needs for sustainability is 300 terawatt hours of batteries. That's the end goal? EM: Very rough numbers, and I certainly would invite others
to check our calculations because they may arrive
at different conclusions. But in order to transition, not just
current electricity production, but also heating and transport, which roughly triples the amount
of electricity that you need, it amounts to approximately 300 terawatt
hours of installed capacity. CA: So we need to give people
a sense of how big a task that is. I mean, here we are at the Gigafactory. You know, this is one of the biggest
buildings in the world. What I've read, and tell me
if this is still right, is that the goal here is to eventually
produce 100 gigawatt hours of batteries here a year eventually. EM: We will probably do more than that, but yes, hopefully we get there
within a couple of years. CA: Right. But I mean, that is one -- EM: 0.1 terrawat hours. CA: But that's still 1/100
of what's needed. How much of the rest of that 100
is Tesla planning to take on let's say, between now and 2030, 2040, when we really need to see
the scale up happen? EM: I mean, these are just guesses. So please, people shouldn't
hold me to these things. It's not like this is like some -- What tends to happen
is I'll make some like, you know, best guess and then people, in five years, there’ll be some jerk
that writes an article: ""Elon said this would happen,
and it didn't happen. He's a liar and a fool."" It's very annoying when that happens. So these are just guesses,
this is a conversation. CA: Right. EM: I think Tesla probably ends up
doing 10 percent of that. Roughly. CA: Let's say 2050 we have this amazing, you know,
100 percent sustainable electric grid made up of, you know, some mixture
of the sustainable energy sources you talked about. That same grid probably
is offering the world really low-cost energy, isn't it, compared with now. And I'm curious about like, are people entitled to get
a little bit excited about the possibilities of that world? EM: People should be optimistic
about the future. Humanity will solve sustainable energy. It will happen if we, you know,
continue to push hard, the future is bright and good
from an energy standpoint. And then it will be possible to also use
that energy to do carbon sequestration. It takes a lot of energy to pull
carbon out of the atmosphere because in putting it in the atmosphere
it releases energy. So now, you know, obviously
in order to pull it out, you need to use a lot of energy. But if you've got a lot of sustainable
energy from wind and solar, you can actually sequester carbon. So you can reverse the CO2 parts
per million of the atmosphere and oceans. And also you can really have
as much fresh water as you want. Earth is mostly water. We should call Earth “Water.” It's 70 percent water by surface area. Now most of that’s seawater, but it's like we just happen to be
on the bit that's land. CA: And with energy,
you can turn seawater into -- EM: Yes. CA: Irrigating water
or whatever water you need. EM: At very low cost. Things will be good. CA: Things will be good. And also, there's other benefits
to this non-fossil fuel world where the air is cleaner -- EM: Yes, exactly. Because, like, when you burn fossil fuels, there's all these side reactions and toxic gases of various kinds. And sort of little particulates
that are bad for your lungs. Like, there's all sorts
of bad things that are happening that will go away. And the sky will be cleaner and quieter. The future's going to be good. CA: I want us to switch now to think
a bit about artificial intelligence. But the segue there, you mentioned how annoying it is
when people call you up for bad predictions in the past. So I'm possibly going to be annoying now, but I’m curious about your timelines
and how you predict and how come some things are so amazingly
on the money and some aren't. So when it comes to predicting sales
of Tesla vehicles, for example, you've kind of been amazing, I think in 2014 when Tesla
had sold that year 60,000 cars, you said, ""2020, I think we will do
half a million a year."" EM: Yeah, we did
almost exactly a half million. CA: You did almost exactly half a million. You were scoffed in 2014
because no one since Henry Ford, with the Model T, had come close
to that kind of growth rate for cars. You were scoffed, and you actually
hit 500,000 cars and then 510,000 or whatever produced. But five years ago,
last time you came to TED, I asked you about full self-driving, and you said, “Yeah, this very year, I'm confident that we will have a car
going from LA to New York without any intervention."" EM: Yeah, I don't want to blow your mind,
but I'm not always right. CA: (Laughs) What's the difference between those two? Why has full self-driving in particular
been so hard to predict? EM: I mean, the thing that really got me, and I think it's going to get
a lot of other people, is that there are just so many
false dawns with self-driving, where you think you've got the problem, have a handle on the problem, and then it, no, turns out
you just hit a ceiling. Because if you were to plot the progress, the progress looks like a log curve. So it's like a series of log curves. So most people don't know
what a log curve is, I suppose. CA: Show the shape with your hands. EM: It goes up you know,
sort of a fairly straight way, and then it starts tailing off and you start getting diminishing returns. And you're like, uh oh, it was trending up and now
it's sort of, curving over and you start getting to these,
what I call local maxima, where you don't realize
basically how dumb you were. And then it happens again. And ultimately... These things, you know,
in retrospect, they seem obvious, but in order to solve
full self-driving properly, you actually have to solve real-world AI. Because what are the road networks
designed to work with? They're designed to work
with a biological neural net, our brains, and with vision, our eyes. And so in order to make it
work with computers, you basically need to solve
real-world AI and vision. Because we need cameras and silicon neural nets in order to have self-driving work for a system that was designed
for eyes and biological neural nets. You know, I guess
when you put it that way, it's sort of, like, quite obvious that the only way
to solve full self-driving is to solve real world AI
and sophisticated vision. CA: What do you feel
about the current architecture? Do you think you have an architecture now where there is a chance for the logarithmic curve
not to tail off any anytime soon? EM: Well I mean, admittedly
these may be infamous last words, but I actually am confident
that we will solve it this year. That we will exceed -- The probability of an accident, at what point do you exceed
that of the average person? I think we will exceed that this year. CA: What are you seeing behind the scenes
that gives you that confidence? EM: We’re almost at the point
where we have a high-quality unified vector space. In the beginning, we were trying
to do this with image recognition on individual images. But if you get one image out of a video, it's actually quite hard to see
what's going on without ambiguity. But if you look at a video segment
of a few seconds of video, that ambiguity resolves. So the first thing we had to do
is tie all eight cameras together so they're synchronized, so that all the frames
are looked at simultaneously and labeled simultaneously by one person, because we still need human labeling. So at least they’re not labeled
at different times by different people in different ways. So it's sort of a surround picture. Then a very important part
is to add the time dimension. So that you’re looking at surround video, and you're labeling surround video. And this is actually quite difficult to do
from a software standpoint. We had to write our own labeling tools and then create auto labeling, create auto labeling software to amplify
the efficiency of human labelers because it’s quite hard to label. In the beginning,
it was taking several hours to label a 10-second video clip. This is not scalable. So basically what you have to have
is you have to have surround video, and that surround video has to be
primarily automatically labeled with humans just being editors and making slight corrections
to the labeling of the video and then feeding back those corrections
into the future auto labeler, so you get this flywheel eventually where the auto labeler
is able to take in vast amounts of video and with high accuracy, automatically label the video
for cars, lane lines, drive space. CA: What you’re saying is ... the result of this is that you're
effectively giving the car a 3D model of the actual objects
that are all around it. It knows what they are, and it knows how fast they are moving. And the remaining task is to predict what the quirky behaviors are
that, you know, that when a pedestrian is walking
down the road with a smaller pedestrian, that maybe that smaller pedestrian
might do something unpredictable or things like that. You have to build into it
before you can really call it safe. EM: You basically need to have
memory across time and space. So what I mean by that is ... Memory can’t be infinite, because it's using up a lot
of the computer's RAM basically. So you have to say how much
are you going to try to remember? It's very common
for things to be occluded. So if you talk about say,
a pedestrian walking past a truck where you saw the pedestrian start
on one side of the truck, then they're occluded by the truck. You would know intuitively, OK, that pedestrian is going to pop out
the other side, most likely. CA: A computer doesn't know it. EM: You need to slow down. CA: A skeptic is going to say
that every year for the last five years, you've kind of said, well, no this is the year, we're confident that it will be there
in a year or two or, you know, like it's always been about that far away. But we've got a new architecture now, you're seeing enough improvement
behind the scenes to make you not certain,
but pretty confident, that, by the end of this year, what in most, not in every city,
and every circumstance but in many cities and circumstances, basically the car will be able
to drive without interventions safer than a human. EM: Yes. I mean, the car currently
drives me around Austin most of the time with no interventions. So it's not like ... And we have over 100,000 people in our full self-driving beta program. So you can look at the videos
that they post online. CA: I do. And some of them are great,
and some of them are a little terrifying. I mean, occasionally
the car seems to veer off and scare the hell out of people. EM: It’s still a beta. CA: But you’re behind the scenes,
looking at the data, you're seeing enough improvement to believe that a this-year
timeline is real. EM: Yes, that's what it seems like. I mean, we could be here
talking again in a year, like, well, another year went by,
and it didn’t happen. But I think this is the year. CA: And so in general,
when people talk about Elon time, I mean it sounds like
you can't just have a general rule that if you predict that something
will be done in six months, actually what we should imagine
is it’s going to be a year or it’s like two-x or three-x,
it depends on the type of prediction. Some things, I guess,
things involving software, AI, whatever, are fundamentally harder
to predict than others. Is there an element that you actually deliberately make
aggressive prediction timelines to drive people to be ambitious? Without that, nothing gets done? EM: Well, I generally believe,
in terms of internal timelines, that we want to set the most aggressive
timeline that we can. Because there’s sort of like
a law of gaseous expansion where, for schedules, where
whatever time you set, it's not going to be less than that. It's very rare
that it'll be less than that. But as far as our predictions
are concerned, what tends to happen in the media is that they will report
all the wrong ones and ignore all the right ones. Or, you know, when writing
an article about me -- I've had a long career
in multiple industries. If you list my sins, I sound
like the worst person on Earth. But if you put those
against the things I've done right, it makes much more sense, you know? So essentially like,
the longer you do anything, the more mistakes
that you will make cumulatively. Which, if you sum up those mistakes, will sound like I'm the worst
predictor ever. But for example, for Tesla vehicle growth, I said I think we’d do 50 percent,
and we’ve done 80 percent. CA: Yes. EM: But they don't mention that one. So, I mean, I'm not sure what my exact
track record is on predictions. They're more optimistic than pessimistic,
but they're not all optimistic. Some of them are exceeded
probably more or later, but they do come true. It's very rare that they do not come true. It's sort of like, you know, if there's some radical
technology prediction, the point is not
that it was a few years late, but that it happened at all. That's the more important part. CA: So it feels like
at some point in the last year, seeing the progress on understanding, the Tesla AI understanding
the world around it, led to a kind of, an aha moment at Tesla. Because you really surprised people
recently when you said probably the most important
product development going on at Tesla this year
is this robot, Optimus. EM: Yes. CA: Many companies out there
have tried to put out these robots, they've been working on them for years. And so far no one has really cracked it. There's no mass adoption
robot in people's homes. There are some in manufacturing,
but I would say, no one's kind of, really cracked it. Is it something that happened in the development of full self-driving
that gave you the confidence to say, ""You know what, we could do
something special here."" EM: Yeah, exactly. So, you know, it took me a while
to sort of realize that in order to solve self-driving, you really needed to solve real-world AI. And at the point of which you solve
real-world AI for a car, which is really a robot on four wheels, you can then generalize that
to a robot on legs as well. The two hard parts I think -- like obviously companies
like Boston Dynamics have shown that it's possible
to make quite compelling, sometimes alarming robots. CA: Right. EM: You know, so from a sensors
and actuators standpoint, it's certainly been demonstrated by many that it's possible to make
a humanoid robot. The things that are currently missing
are enough intelligence for the robot to navigate the real world
and do useful things without being explicitly instructed. So the missing things are basically
real-world intelligence and scaling up manufacturing. Those are two things
that Tesla is very good at. And so then we basically just need
to design the specialized actuators and sensors that are needed
for humanoid robot. People have no idea,
this is going to be bigger than the car. CA: So let's dig into exactly that. I mean, in one way, it's actually
an easier problem than full self-driving because instead of an object
going along at 60 miles an hour, which if it gets it wrong,
someone will die. This is an object that's engineered
to only go at what, three or four or five miles an hour. And so a mistake,
there aren't lives at stake. There might be embarrassment at stake. EM: So long as the AI doesn't take it over
and murder us in our sleep or something. CA: Right. (Laughter) So talk about -- I think the first applications
you've mentioned are probably going to be manufacturing, but eventually the vision is to have
these available for people at home. If you had a robot that really understood
the 3D architecture of your house and knew where every object
in that house was or was supposed to be, and could recognize all those objects, I mean, that’s kind of amazing, isn’t it? Like the kind of thing
that you could ask a robot to do would be what? Like, tidy up? EM: Yeah, absolutely. Make dinner, I guess, mow the lawn. CA: Take a cup of tea to grandma
and show her family pictures. EM: Exactly. Take care
of my grandmother and make sure -- CA: It could obviously recognize
everyone in the home. It could play catch with your kids. EM: Yes. I mean, obviously,
we need to be careful this doesn't become a dystopian situation. I think one of the things
that's going to be important is to have a localized
ROM chip on the robot that cannot be updated over the air. Where if you, for example, were to say,
“Stop, stop, stop,” if anyone said that, then the robot would stop,
you know, type of thing. And that's not updatable remotely. I think it's going to be important
to have safety features like that. CA: Yeah, that sounds wise. EM: And I do think there should be
a regulatory agency for AI. I've said that for many years. I don't love being regulated, but I think this is an important
thing for public safety. CA: Let's come back to that. But I don't think many people
have really sort of taken seriously the notion of, you know, a robot at home. I mean, at the start
of the computing revolution, Bill Gates said there's going to be
a computer in every home. And people at the time said, yeah,
whatever, who would even want that. Do you think there will be basically
like in, say, 2050 or whatever, like a robot in most homes,
is what there will be, and people will love them
and count on them? You’ll have your own butler basically. EM: Yeah, you'll have your sort of
buddy robot probably, yeah. CA: I mean, how much of a buddy? How many applications have you thought, you know, can you have
a romantic partner, a sex partner? EM: It's probably inevitable. I mean, I did promise the internet
that I’d make catgirls. We could make a robot catgirl. CA: Be careful what
you promise the internet. (Laughter) EM: So, yeah, I guess it'll be
whatever people want really, you know. CA: What sort of timeline
should we be thinking about of the first models
that are actually made and sold? EM: Well, you know, the first units
that we intend to make are for jobs that are dangerous,
boring, repetitive, and things that people don't want to do. And, you know, I think we’ll have like
an interesting prototype sometime this year. We might have something useful next year, but I think quite likely
within at least two years. And then we'll see
rapid growth year over year of the usefulness
of the humanoid robots and decrease in cost
and scaling up production. CA: Initially just selling to businesses, or when do you picture
you'll start selling them where you can buy your parents one
for Christmas or something? EM: I'd say in less than ten years. CA: Help me on the economics of this. So what do you picture the cost
of one of these being? EM: Well, I think the cost is actually
not going to be crazy high. Like less than a car. Initially, things will be expensive
because it'll be a new technology at low production volume. The complexity and cost of a car
is greater than that of a humanoid robot. So I would expect that it's going
to be less than a car, or at least equivalent to a cheap car. CA: So even if it starts at 50k,
within a few years, it’s down to 20k or lower or whatever. And maybe for home
they'll get much cheaper still. But think about the economics of this. If you can replace a $30,000, $40,000-a-year worker, which you have to pay every year, with a one-time payment of $25,000 for a robot that can work longer hours, a pretty rapid replacement
of certain types of jobs. How worried should
the world be about that? EM: I wouldn't worry about the sort of,
putting people out of a job thing. I think we're actually going to have,
and already do have, a massive shortage of labor. So I think we will have ... Not people out of work, but actually still a shortage
labor even in the future. But this really will be
a world of abundance. Any goods and services will be available
to anyone who wants them. It'll be so cheap to have goods
and services, it will be ridiculous. CA: I'm presuming it should be possible
to imagine a bunch of goods and services that can't profitably be made now
but could be made in that world, courtesy of legions of robots. EM: Yeah. It will be a world of abundance. The only scarcity
that will exist in the future is that which we decide to create
ourselves as humans. CA: OK. So AI is allowing us to imagine
a differently powered economy that will create this abundance. What are you most worried
about going wrong? EM: Well, like I said,
AI and robotics will bring out what might be termed the age of abundance. Other people have used this word, and that this is my prediction: it will be an age of abundance 
for everyone. But I guess there’s ... The dangers would be
the artificial general intelligence or digital superintelligence decouples
from a collective human will and goes in the direction
that for some reason we don't like. Whatever direction it might go. You know, that’s sort of
the idea behind Neuralink, is to try to more tightly couple
collective human world to digital superintelligence. And also along the way solve a lot
of brain injuries and spinal injuries and that kind of thing. So even if it doesn't succeed
in the greater goal, I think it will succeed in the goal
of alleviating brain and spine damage. CA: So the spirit there is
that if we're going to make these AIs that are so vastly intelligent,
we ought to be wired directly to them so that we ourselves can have
those superpowers more directly. But that doesn't seem to avoid
the risk that those superpowers might ... turn ugly in unintended ways. EM: I think it's a risk, I agree. I'm not saying that I have
some certain answer to that risk. I’m just saying like maybe one of the things
that would be good for ensuring that the future
is one that we want is to more tightly couple the collective human world
to digital intelligence. The issue that we face here
is that we are already a cyborg, if you think about it. The computers are
an extension of ourselves. And when we die, we have,
like, a digital ghost. You know, all of our text messages
and social media, emails. And it's quite eerie actually, when someone dies but everything
online is still there. But you say like, what's the limitation? What is it that inhibits
a human-machine symbiosis? It's the data rate. When you communicate,
especially with a phone, you're moving your thumbs very slowly. So you're like moving
your two little meat sticks at a rate that’s maybe 10 bits per second,
optimistically, 100 bits per second. And computers are communicating
at the gigabyte level and beyond. CA: Have you seen evidence
that the technology is actually working, that you've got a richer, sort of,
higher bandwidth connection, if you like, between like external
electronics and a brain than has been possible before? EM: Yeah. I mean, the fundamental principles
of reading neurons, sort of doing read-write on neurons
with tiny electrodes, have been demonstrated for decades. So it's not like the concept is new. The problem is that there is
no product that works well that you can go and buy. So it's all sort of, in research labs. And it's like some cords
sticking out of your head. And it's quite gruesome,
and it's really ... There's no good product
that actually does a good job and is high-bandwidth and safe and something actually that you could buy
and would want to buy. But the way to think
of the Neuralink device is kind of like a Fitbit
or an Apple Watch. That's where we take out
sort of a small section of skull about the size of a quarter, replace that with what, in many ways really is very much like
a Fitbit, Apple Watch or some kind of smart watch thing. But with tiny, tiny wires, very, very tiny wires. Wires so tiny, it’s hard to even see them. And it's very important
to have very tiny wires so that when they’re implanted,
they don’t damage the brain. CA: How far are you from putting
these into humans? EM: Well, we have put in
our FDA application to aspirationally do the first
human implant this year. CA: The first uses will be
for neurological injuries of different kinds. But rolling the clock forward and imagining when people
are actually using these for their own enhancement, let's say, and for the enhancement of the world, how clear are you in your mind as to what it will feel like
to have one of these inside your head? EM: Well, I do want to emphasize
we're at an early stage. And so it really will be
many years before we have anything approximating
a high-bandwidth neural interface that allows for AI-human symbiosis. For many years, we will just be solving
brain injuries and spinal injuries. For probably a decade. This is not something
that will suddenly one day it will have this incredible
sort of whole brain interface. It's going to be, like I said, at least a decade of really
just solving brain injuries and spinal injuries. And really, I think you can solve
a very wide range of brain injuries, including severe depression,
morbid obesity, sleep, potentially schizophrenia, like, a lot of things that cause
great stress to people. Restoring memory in older people. CA: If you can pull that off,
that's the app I will sign up for. EM: Absolutely. CA: Please hurry. (Laughs) EM: I mean, the emails that we get
at Neuralink are heartbreaking. I mean, they'll send us
just tragic, you know, where someone was sort of,
in the prime of life and they had an accident on a motorcycle and someone who's 25, you know,
can't even feed themselves. And this is something we could fix. CA: But you have said that AI is one
of the things you're most worried about and that Neuralink may be one of the ways where we can keep abreast of it. EM: Yeah, there's the short-term thing, which I think is helpful on an individual
human level with injuries. And then the long-term thing is an attempt to address the civilizational risk of AI by bringing digital intelligence and biological intelligence
closer together. I mean, if you think of how
the brain works today, there are really two layers to the brain. There's the limbic system and the cortex. You've got the kind of,
animal brain where -- it’s kind of like the fun part, really. CA: It's where most of Twitter
operates, by the way. EM: I think Tim Urban said, we’re like somebody, you know,
stuck a computer on a monkey. You know, so we're like,
if you gave a monkey a computer, that's our cortex. But we still have a lot
of monkey instincts. Which we then try to rationalize
as, no, it's not a monkey instinct. It’s something more important than that. But it's often just really
a monkey instinct. We're just monkeys with a computer
stuck in our brain. But even though the cortex
is sort of the smart, or the intelligent part of the brain, the thinking part of the brain, I've not yet met anyone
who wants to delete their limbic system or their cortex. They're quite happy having both. Everyone wants both parts of their brain. And people really want their
phones and their computers, which are really the tertiary,
the third part of your intelligence. It's just that it's ... Like the bandwidth, the rate of communication
with that tertiary layer is slow. And it's just a very tiny straw
to this tertiary layer. And we want to make that tiny
straw a big highway. And I’m definitely not saying
that this is going to solve everything. Or this is you know,
it’s the only thing -- it’s something that might be helpful. And worst-case scenario, I think we solve
some important brain injury, spinal injury issues,
and that's still a great outcome. CA: Best-case scenario, we may discover new
human possibility, telepathy, you've spoken of, in a way,
a connection with a loved one, you know, full memory and much faster
thought processing maybe. All these things. It's very cool. If AI were to take down Earth,
we need a plan B. Let's shift our attention to space. We spoke last time at TED
about reusability, and you had just demonstrated that
spectacularly for the first time. Since then, you've gone on to build
this monster rocket, Starship, which kind of changes the rules
of the game in spectacular ways. Tell us about Starship. EM: Starship is extremely fundamental. So the holy grail of rocketry
or space transport is full and rapid reusability. This has never been achieved. The closest that anything has come
is our Falcon 9 rocket, where we are able to recover
the first stage, the boost stage, which is probably about 60 percent
of the cost of the vehicle of the whole launch, maybe 70 percent. And we've now done that
over a hundred times. So with Starship, we will be
recovering the entire thing. Or at least that's the goal. CA: Right. EM: And moreover,
recovering it in such a way that it can be immediately re-flown. Whereas with Falcon 9, we still need
to do some amount of refurbishment to the booster and
to the fairing nose cone. But with Starship, the design goal
is immediate re-flight. So you just refill
propellants and go again. And this is gigantic. Just as it would be
in any other mode of transport. CA: And the main design is to basically take
100 plus people at a time, plus a bunch of things
that they need, to Mars. So, first of all, talk about that piece. What is your latest timeline? One, for the first time,
a Starship goes to Mars, presumably without people,
but just equipment. Two, with people. Three, there’s sort of, OK, 100 people at a time, let's go. EM: Sure. And just to put the cost
thing into perspective, the expected cost of Starship, putting 100 tons into orbit, is significantly less
than what it would have cost or what it did cost to put our tiny
Falcon 1 rocket into orbit. Just as the cost of flying
a 747 around the world is less than the cost of a small airplane. You know, a small airplane
that was thrown away. So it's really pretty mind-boggling
that the giant thing costs less, way less than the small thing. So it doesn't use exotic propellants or things that are difficult
to obtain on Mars. It uses methane as fuel, and it's primarily oxygen,
roughly 77-78 percent oxygen by weight. And Mars has a CO2 atmosphere
and has water ice, which is CO2 plus H2O,
so you can make CH4, methane, and O2, oxygen, on Mars. CA: Presumably, one of the first tasks
on Mars will be to create a fuel plant that can create the fuel
for the return trips of many Starships. EM: Yes. And actually, it's mostly
going to be oxygen plants, because it's 78 percent oxygen,
22 percent fuel. But the fuel is a simple fuel
that is easy to create on Mars. And in many other parts
of the solar system. So basically ... And it's all propulsive landing,
no parachutes, nothing thrown away. It has a heat shield that’s capable
of entering on Earth or Mars. We can even potentially go to Venus. but you don't want to go there. (Laughs) Venus is hell, almost literally. But you could ... It's a generalized method of transport
to anywhere in the solar system, because the point at which
you have propellant depo on Mars, you can then travel to the asteroid belt and to the moons of Jupiter and Saturn and ultimately anywhere
in the solar system. CA: But your main focus and SpaceX's main focus is still Mars. That is the mission. That is where most of the effort will go? Or are you actually imagining
a much broader array of uses even in the coming, you know, the first decade or so of uses of this. Where we could go,
for example, to other places in the solar system to explore, perhaps NASA wants to use
the rocket for that reason. EM: Yeah, NASA is planning to use
a Starship to return to the moon, to return people to the moon. And so we're very honored that NASA
has chosen us to do this. But I'm saying it is a generalized -- it’s a general solution to getting anywhere
in the greater solar system. It's not suitable for going
to another star system, but it is a general solution for transport
anywhere in the solar system. CA: Before it can do any of that, it's got to demonstrate it can get into
orbit, you know, around Earth. What’s your latest advice
on the timeline for that? EM: It's looking promising for us
to have an orbital launch attempt in a few months. So we're actually integrating -- will be integrating the engines
into the booster for the first orbital flight
starting in about a week or two. And the launch complex
itself is ready to go. So assuming we get regulatory approval, I think we could have an orbital
launch attempt within a few months. CA: And a radical new technology like this presumably there is real risk
on those early attempts. EM: Oh, 100 percent, yeah. The joke I make all the time
is that excitement is guaranteed. Success is not guaranteed,
but excitement certainly is. CA: But the last I saw on your timeline, you've slightly put back the expected date to put the first human on Mars
till 2029, I want to say? EM: Yeah, I mean, so let's see. I mean, we have built a production
system for Starship, so we're making a lot
of ships and boosters. CA: How many are you planning
to make actually? EM: Well, we're currently expecting
to make a booster and a ship roughly every, well, initially,
roughly every couple of months, and then hopefully by the end
of this year, one every month. So it's giant rockets, and a lot of them. Just talking in terms
of rough orders of magnitude, in order to create
a self-sustaining city on Mars, I think you will need something
on the order of a thousand ships. And we just need a Helen of Sparta,
I guess, on Mars. CA: This is not in most
people's heads, Elon. EM: The planet that launched 1,000 ships. CA: That's nice. But this is not in most people's heads, this picture that you have in your mind. There's basically a two-year window, you can only really fly to Mars
conveniently every two years. You were picturing that during the 2030s, every couple of years, something like 1,000 Starships take off, each containing 100 or more people. That picture is just completely
mind-blowing to me. That sense of this armada
of humans going to -- EM: It'll be like ""Battlestar
Galactica,"" the fleet departs. CA: And you think that it can
basically be funded by people spending maybe a couple hundred grand
on a ticket to Mars? Is that price about where it has been? EM: Well, I think if you say like, what's required in order to get
enough people and enough cargo to Mars to build a self-sustaining city. And it's where you have an intersection of sets of people who want to go, because I think only a small percentage
of humanity will want to go, and can afford to go
or get sponsorship in some manner. That intersection of sets, I think, needs to be a million people
or something like that. And so it’s what can a million people
afford, or get sponsorship for, because I think governments
will also pay for it, and people can take out loans. But I think at the point
at which you say, OK, like, if moving to Mars costs are,
for argument’s sake, $100,000, then I think you know,
almost anyone can work and save up and eventually have $100,000
and be able to go to Mars if they want. We want to make it available
to anyone who wants to go. It's very important to emphasize
that Mars, especially in the beginning, will not be luxurious. It will be dangerous, cramped,
difficult, hard work. It's kind of like that Shackleton ad
for going to the Antarctic, which I think is actually not real,
but it sounds real and it's cool. It's sort of like, the sales pitch
for going to Mars is, ""It's dangerous, it's cramped. You might not make it back. It's difficult, it's hard work."" That's the sales pitch. CA: Right. But you will make history. EM: But it'll be glorious. CA: So on that kind of launch rate
you're talking about over two decades, you could get your million people
to Mars, essentially. Whose city is it? Is it NASA's city, is it SpaceX's city? EM: It’s the people of Mars’ city. The reason for this, I mean,
I feel like why do this thing? I think this is important for maximizing the probable lifespan of humanity
or consciousness. Human civilization could come
to an end for external reasons, like a giant meteor or super volcanoes
or extreme climate change. Or World War III, or you know,
any one of a number of reasons. But the probable life span
of civilizational consciousness as we know it, which we should really view
as this very delicate thing, like a small candle in a vast darkness. That is what appears to be the case. We're in this vast darkness of space, and there's this little
candle of consciousness that’s only really come about
after 4.5 billion years, and it could just go out. CA: I think that's powerful, and I think a lot of people
will be inspired by that vision. And the reason you need the million people is because there has to be
enough people there to do everything that you need to survive. EM: Really, like the critical threshold
is if the ships from Earth stop coming for any reason, does the Mars City die out or not? And so we have to -- You know, people talk about like,
the sort of, the great filters, the things that perhaps, you know, we talk about the Fermi paradox,
and where are the aliens? Well maybe there are these
various great filters that the aliens didn’t pass, and so they eventually
just ceased to exist. And one of the great filters
is becoming a multi-planet species. So we want to pass that filter. And I'll be long-dead before
this is, you know, a real thing, before it happens. But I’d like to at least see us make
great progress in this direction. CA: Given how tortured
the Earth is right now, how much we're beating each other up, shouldn't there be discussions going on with everyone who is dreaming
about Mars to try to say, we've got a once
in a civilization's chance to make some new rules here? Should someone be trying
to lead those discussions to figure out what it means for this
to be the people of Mars' City? EM: Well, I think ultimately this will be up to the people
of Mars to decide how they want to rethink society. Yeah there’s certainly risk there. And hopefully the people of Mars
will be more enlightened and will not fight
amongst each other too much. I mean, I have some recommendations, which people of Mars
may choose to listen to or not. I would advocate for more
of a direct democracy, not a representative democracy, and laws that are short enough
for people to understand. Where it is harder to create laws
than to get rid of them. CA: Coming back a bit nearer term, I'd love you to just talk a bit
about some of the other possibility space that Starship seems to have created. So given -- Suddenly we've got this ability
to move 100 tons-plus into orbit. So we've just launched
the James Webb telescope, which is an incredible thing. It's unbelievable. EM: Exquisite piece of technology. CA: Exquisite piece of technology. But people spent two years trying
to figure out how to fold up this thing. It's a three-ton telescope. EM: We can make it a lot easier
if you’ve got more volume and mass. CA: But let's ask a different question. Which is, how much more powerful
a telescope could someone design based on using Starship, for example? EM: I mean, roughly, I'd say it's probably
an order of magnitude more resolution. If you've got 100 tons
and a thousand cubic meters volume, which is roughly what we have. CA: And what about other exploration
through the solar system? I mean, I'm you know -- EM: Europa is a big question mark. CA: Right, so there's an ocean there. And what you really want to do
is to drop a submarine into that ocean. EM: Maybe there's like,
some squid civilization, cephalopod civilization
under the ice of Europa. That would be pretty interesting. CA: I mean, Elon, if you could take
a submarine to Europa and we see pictures of this thing
being devoured by a squid, that would honestly be
the happiest moment of my life. EM: Pretty wild, yeah. CA: What other possibilities
are out there? Like, it feels like if you're going to
create a thousand of these things, they can only fly to Mars every two years. What are they doing the rest of the time? It feels like there's this
explosion of possibility that I don't think people
are really thinking about. EM: I don't know, we've certainly
got a long way to go. As you alluded to earlier,
we still have to get to orbit. And then after we get to orbit, we have to really prove out and refine
full and rapid reusability. That'll take a moment. But I do think we will solve this. I'm highly confident
we will solve this at this point. CA: Do you ever wake up with the fear that there's going to be this
Hindenburg moment for SpaceX where ... EM: We've had many Hindenburg. Well, we've never had Hindenburg moments
with people, which is very important. Big difference. We've blown up quite a few rockets. So there's a whole compilation online
that we put together and others put together, it's showing rockets are hard. I mean, the sheer amount of energy
going through a rocket boggles the mind. So, you know, getting out
of Earth's gravity well is difficult. We have a strong gravity
and a thick atmosphere. And Mars, which is less than 40 percent, it's like, 37 percent of Earth's gravity and has a thin atmosphere. The ship alone can go all the way from the surface of Mars
to the surface of Earth. Whereas getting to Mars requires
a giant booster and orbital refilling. CA: So, Elon, as I think more
about this incredible array of things that you're involved with, I keep seeing these synergies, to use a horrible word, between them. You know, for example, the robots you're building from Tesla
could possibly be pretty handy on Mars, doing some of the dangerous
work and so forth. I mean, maybe there's a scenario
where your city on Mars doesn't need a million people, it needs half a million people
and half a million robots. And that's a possibility. Maybe The Boring Company could play a role helping create some of the subterranean
dwelling spaces that you might need. EM: Yeah. CA: Back on planet Earth, it seems like a partnership
between Boring Company and Tesla could offer an unbelievable deal to a city to say, we will create for you
a 3D network of tunnels populated by robo-taxis that will offer fast, low-cost
transport to anyone. You know, full self-driving may
or may not be done this year. And in some cities,
like, somewhere like Mumbai, I suspect won't be done for a decade. EM: Some places are more
challenging than others. CA: But today, today,
with what you've got, you could put a 3D network
of tunnels under there. EM: Oh, if it’s just in a tunnel,
that’s a solved problem. CA: Exactly, full self-driving
is a solved problem. To me, there’s amazing synergy there. With Starship, you know, Gwynne Shotwell talked
about by 2028 having from city to city, you know, transport on planet Earth. EM: This is a real possibility. The fastest way to get
from one place to another, if it's a long distance, is a rocket. It's basically an ICBM. CA: But it has to land -- Because it's an ICBM,
it has to land probably offshore, because it's loud. So why not have a tunnel
that then connects to the city with Tesla? And Neuralink. I mean, if you going to go to Mars having a telepathic connection
with loved ones back home, even if there's a time delay... EM: These are not intended
to be connected, by the way. But there certainly could be
some synergies, yeah. CA: Surely there is a growing argument that you should actually put
all these things together into one company and just have a company
devoted to creating a future that’s exciting, and let a thousand flowers bloom. Have you been thinking about that? EM: I mean, it is tricky because Tesla
is a publicly-traded company, and the investor base of Tesla and SpaceX and certainly Boring Company
and Neuralink are quite different. Boring Company and Neuralink
are tiny companies. CA: By comparison. EM: Yeah, Tesla's got 110,000 people. SpaceX I think is around 12,000 people. Boring Company and Neuralink
are both under 200 people. So they're little, tiny companies, but they will probably
get bigger in the future. They will get bigger in the future. It's not that easy to sort
of combine these things. CA: Traditionally, you have said
that for SpaceX especially, you wouldn't want it public, because public investors wouldn't support
the craziness of the idea of going to Mars or whatever. EM: Yeah, making life multi-planetary is outside of the normal time horizon
of Wall Street analysts. (Laughs) To say the least. CA: I think something's changed, though. What's changed is that Tesla is now
so powerful and so big and throws off so much cash that you actually could
connect the dots here. Just tell the public that x-billion
dollars a year, whatever your number is, will be diverted to the Mars mission. I suspect you'd have massive
interest in that company. And it might unlock a lot
more possibility for you, no? EM: I would like to give the public access
to ownership of SpaceX, but I mean the thing that like, the overhead associated
with a public company is high. I mean, as a public company,
you're just constantly sued. It does occupy like, a fair bit of ... You know, time and effort
to deal with these things. CA: But you would still only have one
public company, it would be bigger, and have more things going on. But instead of being
on four boards, you'd be on one. EM: I'm actually not even on the Neuralink
or Boring Company boards. And I don't really attend
the SpaceX board meetings. We only have two a year, and I just stop by and chat for an hour. The board overhead for a public
company is much higher. CA: I think some investors probably worry
about how your time is being split, and they might be excited
by you know, that. Anyway, I just woke up the other day thinking, just, there are so many ways
in which these things connect. And you know,
just the simplicity of that mission, of building a future that is worth
getting excited about, might appeal to an awful lot of people. Elon, you are reported by Forbes
and everyone else as now, you know, the world's richest person. EM: That’s not a sovereign. CA: (Laughs) EM: You know, I think it’s fair to say that if somebody is like, the king
or de facto king of a country, they're wealthier than I am. CA: But it’s just harder to measure -- So $300 billion. I mean, your net worth on any given day is rising or falling
by several billion dollars. How insane is that? EM: It's bonkers, yeah. CA: I mean, how do you handle
that psychologically? There aren't many people in the world
who have to even think about that. EM: I actually don't think
about that too much. But the thing that is
actually more difficult and that does make sleeping difficult is that, you know, every good hour or even minute of thinking about Tesla and SpaceX has such a big effect on the company that I really try to work
as much as possible, you know, to the edge
of sanity, basically. Because you know,
Tesla’s getting to the point where probably will get
to the point later this year, where every high-quality
minute of thinking is a million dollars impact on Tesla. Which is insane. I mean, the basic, you know,
if Tesla is doing, you know, sort of $2 billion a week,
let’s say, in revenue, it’s sort of $300 million a day,
seven days a week. You know, it's ... CA: If you can change that by five percent
in an hour’s brainstorm, that's a pretty valuable hour. EM: I mean, there are many instances
where a half-hour meeting, I was able to improve
the financial outcome of the company by $100 million
in a half-hour meeting. CA: There are many other people out there who can't stand
this world of billionaires. Like, they are hugely
offended by the notion that an individual can have
the same wealth as, say, a billion or more
of the world's poorest people. EM: If they examine sort of -- I think there's some axiomatic flaws
that are leading them to that conclusion. For sure, it would be very
problematic if I was consuming, you know, billions of dollars a year
in personal consumption. But that is not the case. In fact, I don't even own
a home right now. I'm literally staying at friends' places. If I travel to the Bay Area, which is where most
of Tesla engineering is, I basically rotate through
friends' spare bedrooms. I don't have a yacht,
I really don't take vacations. It’s not as though my personal
consumption is high. I mean, the one exception is a plane. But if I don't use the plane,
then I have less hours to work. CA: I mean, I personally think
you have shown that you are mostly driven by really quite a deep
sense of moral purpose. Like, your attempts to solve
the climate problem have been as powerful as anyone else
on the planet that I'm aware of. And I actually can't understand, personally, I can't understand the fact that you get all this criticism
from the Left about, ""Oh, my God, he's so rich,
that's disgusting."" When climate is their issue. Philanthropy is a topic
that some people go to. Philanthropy is a hard topic. How do you think about that? EM: I think if you care
about the reality of goodness instead of the perception of it,
philanthropy is extremely difficult. SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink
and The Boring Company are philanthropy. If you say philanthropy
is love of humanity, they are philanthropy. Tesla is accelerating sustainable energy. This is a love -- philanthropy. SpaceX is trying to ensure
the long-term survival of humanity with a multiple-planet species. That is love of humanity. You know, Neuralink is trying to help
solve brain injuries and existential risk with AI. Love of humanity. Boring Company is trying to solve traffic,
which is hell for most people, and that also is love of humanity. CA: How upsetting is it to you to hear this constant drumbeat of, ""Billionaires, my God,
Elon Musk, oh, my God?"" Like, do you just shrug that off or does it does it actually hurt? EM: I mean, at this point,
it's water off a duck's back. CA: Elon, I’d like to,
as we wrap up now, just pull the camera back
and just think ... You’re a father now
of seven surviving kids. EM: Well, I mean, I'm trying
to set a good example because the birthrate on Earth is so low that we're facing civilizational collapse unless the birth rate returns
to a sustainable level. CA: Yeah, you've talked about this a lot, that depopulation is a big problem, and people don't understand
how big a problem it is. EM: Population collapse
is one of the biggest threats to the future of human civilization. And that is what is going on right now. CA: What drives you on a day-to-day
basis to do what you do? EM: I guess, like,
I really want to make sure that there is a good future for humanity and that we're on a path to understanding
the nature of the universe, the meaning of life. Why are we here, how did we get here? And in order to understand
the nature of the universe and all these fundamental questions, we must expand the scope
and scale of consciousness. Certainly it must not diminish or go out. Or we certainly won’t understand this. I would say I’ve been motivated
by curiosity more than anything, and just desire to think about the future and not be sad, you know? CA: And are you? Are you not sad? EM: I'm sometimes sad, but mostly I'm feeling I guess relatively optimistic
about the future these days. There are certainly some big
risks that humanity faces. I think the population collapse
is a really big deal, that I wish more people would think about because the birth rate is far below
what's needed to sustain civilization at its current level. And there's obviously ... We need to take action
on climate sustainability, which is being done. And we need to secure
the future of consciousness by being a multi-planet species. We need to address -- Essentially, it's important to take
whatever actions we can think of to address the existential risks
that affect the future of consciousness. CA: There's a whole
generation coming through who seem really sad about the future. What would you say to them? EM: Well, I think if you want the future
to be good, you must make it so. Take action to make it good. And it will be. CA: Elon, thank you for all this time. That is a beautiful place to end. Thanks for all you're doing. EM: You're welcome.",2022-04-18T00:08:54Z
The Hidden Power of Sad Songs and Rainy Days,Susan Cain and Min Kym,226444,0,197,"Have you ever wondered why you like sad music? Do you find comfort or inspiration in rainy days? In this profound, poetic talk, ...","When I was in my early 30s, I was an associate
at a Wall Street law firm. And I had been working 16-hour days
for seven years straight. And even though,
ever since I was four years old, I'd had this beautiful
and impossible dream of becoming a writer, I was also pretty ambitious
and on the verge of making partner. Or so I thought. Because, one day, a senior partner
named Steve Shalen knocked on my office door. Steve was tall and distinguished
and very decent. And he sat down and he reached
for the squishy stress ball on my desk, and he said that I wasn't
going to be making partner after all. And I remember very badly
wishing that I had a stress ball too, but Steve Shalen was using mine. And I remember feeling sorry
that it had fallen to Steve to be the one to tell me this news, because he really was a good guy. And I remember bursting into tears
right in front of him, such a nonpartnerish thing to do. But that very afternoon
I up and left my law firm for good. And a few weeks after that
ended a seven-year relationship that had always felt wrong. And so, now I was in my early 30s, and suddenly I had no career, no love, no place to live. And immediately,
I fell into a relationship with a handsome musician who liked to compose lyrics by day and stand around a piano
with friends, singing, at night. And he was the wrong guy
for various reasons, but my feelings for him developed into this crazy obsession, the likes of which I have never
experienced before or since, thankfully. No matter what I did,
I couldn't escape it. Until one day, a friend said to me, “You are this hooked because he represents
something you're longing for. What are you longing for?"" And the answer came to me
with a sudden clarity. It was like, of course, he was the writing life that I had longed for
since I was four years old. He was an emissary
from the beautiful world. And just like that,
the obsession fell away, and I started writing for real. Today, I want to talk with you
about a state of mind that's ancient and universal and enormously powerful and, strangely, these days overlooked. The author C.S. Lewis
called this state of mind ""the inconsolable longing
for we know not what."" And he was mesmerized by it all his life. As am I. When I was 22 years old
and I was still in law school, some friends came by my dorm room to pick me up on the way to class. And I had been sitting
and listening to bittersweet music, which is something
I've been doing all my life. (Music: ""Adagio in G Minor"" by Albinoni) (Music ends) OK, so the music is a little bit gloomy. It's full of longing, right? Maybe for a lost love
that never existed in the first place, but the curious thing is, when I hear music like this, I don't really feel sad or not very sad. What I actually feel
is something that's much closer to joy. And I could never understand why this was. But meanwhile, I noticed
that my law school classmates were feeling very little joy. One of them asked me
why I was listening to funeral music. (Laughter) And I laughed, and we went off to class. End of story. Except that I thought
about that comment of his for literally the next 25 years. Why do I find sad music so uplifting? And what is it in our culture that makes it feel
a fitting subject for a joke? And why, even right this minute, do I feel an intense desire to assure you
that I love dance music too? I really do. At first, these were just
interesting questions, but as I looked
for the answers over the years, I started to realize
that, really, they were the questions. They were the big ones, I just hadn't known it yet. So here's what I found out. Lots of people feel the way I do
about sad music, especially sensitive types. People play the happy songs
on their playlists about 175 times on average, but they play the sad songs 800 times. And they tell researchers
that they associate sad music with beauty and wonder and transcendence, the so-called sublime emotions. And you know, just think
of how many musical genres tap into sorrow, right. There’s Spanish flamenco
and Portuguese fado and the Irish lament and American country music and the blues. And then even lullabies, which all over the world we often use
our most heartbreaking melodies to sing our newborns to sleep. Why on Earth do we do that? (Laughter) And then it's not just music, right? We like rainy days and tragic drama and cherry blossoms, which we celebrate
over equally lovely flowers partly because they die young. Philosophers call that
the paradox of tragedy. Why do we sometimes welcome sorrow when the rest of the time
we will quite naturally do anything we can to avoid it? There's actually a scholarly debate
raging over this question, but I have come to believe that really, what we are craving, at bottom, is that state of longing, that joy that's laced with sorrow. Which is often triggered when we experience something so exquisite that it seems to come to us
from some other world. And this is why we give
painters and rock stars such exalted status. Because they're the ones
who bring us the breath of magic from that other place. Except it only lasts a moment, and we really want to live there for good. Because we know that we live
in a deeply flawed world. And we have this stubborn conviction that we come from a perfect
and beautiful one that remains forever out of reach. And maybe that sounds depressing to you, but this state of mind, this longing, is actually the deep source of all our moonshots and our loves. It's because of longing that we play ""Moonlight Sonatas"" and build rockets to Mars. And it's because we're all in this
same strange state of exile that we have the capacity to empathize
with each other in the first place. Our broken hearts, taught an 18-century rabbi
named Nahman of Bratslav, they connect us to each other and to that other world
where the music comes form. But modern culture
is telling us a really different story. It's telling us to smile
and get over it and move on. And of course it's true, positivity is very powerful as well. And it's possible to get stuck
in your longing and to never come out. So I do want to be really clear, this is not an argument for depression. And -- (Laughter) If that's what you think
you're experiencing, please, please do go seek help. I'm talking about a different
state of mind that we all live in, where the light and the dark
move together. And I am saying that right now, our culture is afraid of the dark. And that all this normative sunshine can distract you
from your rightful heritage. In Homer's ""Odyssey,"" it was homesickness, it was the longing for home that caused Odysseus to take
that epic journey in the first place. The poem starts with him
weeping on a beach. And in most every children's book
you've ever loved, the hero is an orphan first. Think of Harry Potter -- broken before the story even starts. Longing is also
the beating heart, of course, of most of the world's religions. We long for Eden and Zion, and we long for the Beloved, which is the beautiful word
the Sufis have for God. So sometime after I left
my law firm and the musician, I met Ken, who would become my husband. Ken is a writer, too, and he had spent the past decade doing UN peacekeeping negotiations in Rwanda and Liberia and Somalia. And he had done that work because underneath
his very exuberant personality, he was filled with his own longing
for another world. He'd grown up haunted by the Holocaust. He used to lie awake at night
when he was 10 years old wondering would he have had the guts
to hide Anne Frank in his attic. And it turned out
that he did have the courage, even if his dreams of peace
never did come true. To this day, he keeps on his desk a photo of a pile of bones
from the Rwandan genocide. When we met, Ken was getting ready
to publish a book on his experiences, and it was getting optioned for TV. And in contrast,
I had this failed legal career and some poems that I had written. At the time, I was working
on a memoir in sonnet form, because why not. But I brought the sonnets
to our second date, and I showed them to Ken. And later that night, this is the email that he sent me. [Holy Sh*t. My favorite line: I'm Penelope's descendant/
Heiress to a life transcendent Keep writing. Drop Everything.
Write. Write woman, write.] (Laughter and applause) So Ken's exuberant faith helped to make my longing a reality. But those dreams of peace he had had, you know, we're all
still waiting for those, right? Which is the way it often goes, the beautiful world just out of reach. But while we're waiting, our broken hearts
can also help to connect us. (Music: ""Adagio in G Minor"" by Albinoni) (Music ends) In 1992, the city of Sarajevo was under siege. For centuries, Muslims,
Catholics and Eastern Orthodox had lived together
in this very vibrant city. And now, the streets were dead quiet. Except for the crackling sounds
of the snipers' gunshots. Until one day, when a bombed-out bakery filled with the strains
of Albinoni's ""Adagio in G Minor,"" which is what you've just
been listening to, thanks to the otherworldly talents
of my dear friend, Min Kym. (Applause) The Albinoni that day
was played by Vedran Smailović, the lead cellist of the Sarajevo Opera, in honor of 22 people
who had been killed the morning before, as they lined up for bread. Dressed in a formal white shirt
and black tails, as if for a night at the opera, he sat down on a white plastic chair on a mound of rubble, and he played his cello. And he did that every day for 22 days under sniper fire that never stopped him. ""You ask me am I crazy to play my cello
in the middle of a war zone,"" he said, ""Why don't you ask them
if they're crazy for shelling Sarajevo?"" A few months after that, the BBC foreign correspondent,
Allan Little, writes that he watched as a procession
of 40,000 people emerged from a nearby forest. They had been walking for 48 hours
to flee a military attack. And among them was an old man. He was dazed and exhausted. And he asked Allan Little, ""Have you seen my wife, we got separated in the forest, I don't know whether she's made it."" And Little said to him, ""Do you mind if I ask you,
are you a Muslim or a Croat?"" And the old man's answer, he says, shames him even now,
as he recalls it across the decades. ""I am,"" said the old man, ""a musician."" (Music: ""Adagio in G Minor"") (Music ends) In Hebrew, the word
for longing, leh-heesh-toh-kek, it comes from the same word, from the same root, as the word for passion. The place you suffer
is the same exact place where you care desperately. It's the same place that inspires you
to ease someone's pain however you can. And it's the place that you vibrate with the insane beauty of this world. So, remember, there's light
and there's dark. And when the dark times come, and they will come, don't be surprised, but ask yourself:
What are you longing for? And follow your longing
where it's telling you to go. It's pointing you
in the direction of the sacred. If you don't like
that word sacred, I get it, call it the wondrous instead. You don't, you absolutely
don't have to believe in the deities of the ancient books to know that spiritual longing is real, and that humanity
is steeped in the sublime. Once you look, you will see it
everywhere around you. It's in the arch
of your best friend's eyebrow when she makes a joke. It's in the smallpox vaccines
and the Golden Gate bridges that humans somehow managed to invent against all odds. It's in the surge of love
you feel for a cellist who did a brave and miraculous thing during a misbegotten war in 1992. And it's right here in this room. Follow your longing
where it’s telling you to go, and may it carry you
straight to the beating heart of the perfect and beautiful world. Thank you so much. (Applause)",2022-04-05T11:00:01Z
The War in Ukraine Could Change Everything,Yuval Noah Harari,4686600,0,15447,Concerned about the war Ukraine? You're not alone. Historian Yuval Noah Harari provides important context on the Russian ...,"Bruno Giussani: We are at the end
of day six of the war in Ukraine or, more correctly,
of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, launched on February 24
by President Vladimir Putin. We are all shocked
and saddened by the events and by the human suffering
they are causing. And as we speak, really, a Russian military convoy
is headed towards Kyiv, other Ukrainian cities
are being bombarded, half a million Ukrainians have already
fled to neighboring countries and much more. It's still early days, and it's difficult to predict
how the situation will evolve even just in the next few hours. But this is a war that should concern
everyone, everywhere. And so today, in this TED
Membership conversation, we want to try to give it
a broader context with our guest, historian and author, Yuval Noah Harari. Yuval, welcome. Yuval Noah Harari: Hello. Thank you for inviting me. BG: I want to start from Ukraine itself
and its 42 million people and its particular place
between the East and the West. What do we need to know about Ukraine to understand this war
and what's at stake? YNH: The most crucial thing to know
is that Ukrainians are not Russians, and that Ukraine is an ancient,
independent nation. Ukraine has a history
of more than a thousand years. Kyiv was a major metropolis
and cultural center when Moscow was not even a village. For most of these thousand years
Kyiv was not ruled by Moscow. They were not part
of the same political entity. For centuries, Kyiv was looking westwards and was a part of a union
with Lithuania and Poland until it was eventually conquered
and absorbed by the Russian Empire, by the czarist empire. But even after that, Ukrainians remained
a separate people to a large extent, and it's important to know that because this is really
what is at stake in this war. The key issue of the war, at least for President Putin, is whether Ukraine
is an independent nation, whether it is a nation at all. He has this fantasy
that Ukraine isn't a nation, that Ukraine is just a part of Russia, that Ukrainians are Russians. In his fantasy, Ukrainians are Russians that want
to be back in the fold of Mother Russia, and that the only ones preventing it
is a very small gang at the top, which he portrays as Nazis, even if the president is Jewish;
but OK, a Nazi Jew. And his belief was, at least, that he just needs to invade, Zelenskyy will flee, the government will collapse, the army would lay down its arms, and the Ukrainian people
would welcome the Russian liberators, throwing flowers on them. And this fantasy
has been shattered already. Zelenskyy hasn’t fled, the Ukrainian army is fighting. And the Ukrainian people is not throwing
flowers on the Russian tanks, it's throwing Molotov cocktails. BG: So let's unpack that and maybe take the different
pieces one way one. So Ukraine has a long history
of being dominated and occupied. You mentioned the czar,
but also the Soviet Union, Hitler's armies. It also has a long history of mistrust
of authority and of resistance, which goes some way to explain
the current strong resistance that the Russians are encountering. Anne Applebaum, the journalist,
even suggests that this mistrust, this resistance to authority, is the very essence
of Ukraine-ness, do you agree? YNH: We did see in the last 30 years
Ukrainians twice rising in revolt when there was a danger of an authoritarian regime
being established -- once in 2004, once in 2013. And when I was in Kyiv a few years ago, what really struck me
was this very strong feeling of the desire for independence
and for democracy. And I remember walking around this museum of the Revolution of 2013-2014 and seeing these images,
like these two elderly women who were bringing sandwiches
to the demonstrators, to the fighters. They couldn’t throw stones
and they couldn’t do anything else, so they prepared sandwiches and brought this huge tray
full of sandwiches to the demonstrators. And this, yes, this is the kind of spirit that inspires not just the Ukrainians but everybody who is now watching
what is happening there. BG: Help me understand
the actual nature of the threat here in terms of Russia moving into Ukraine. So in your last book,
when you write about Russia, you describe the Russian model as:
“not a coherent political ideology, but rather a sort of practice
of monopolizing power and wealth by a small group at the top."" But then, in his actions against Ukraine, Putin in the last few weeks seems to move
very much by an ideology, an ideology of empire,
of denial of Ukraine's right to exist, as you mention. What has changed in the four years
since you wrote that book? YNH: The imperial dream was always there, but you know, empires
are often the creation of a very small gang of people at the top. I don’t think the Russian people
[are] interested in this war. I don't think that the Russian people
want to conquer Ukraine or to slaughter the citizens of Kyiv. It's all coming from the top. So there is no change there. I mean, when you look at the Soviet Union, you can say that there was
this mass ideology, which was shared by a large proportion,
or some proportion, of the population. You don't see this now. You know, Russia is a very rich country, rich in resources, but most people are very poor. Their standard of living is very, very low because all the wealth and power
is kind of sucked by the people at the top, and very little is left
for everybody else. So I don't think it's a society where the masses are part
of this kind of ideological project. They're being ruled from the top. And you have this classic
imperial situation, when the emperor, which controls the largest
country in the world, feels that, ""Hey, this is not enough. I need more."" And sends his army to capture, to extend the empire. BG: I said at the beginning that it's difficult, of course,
to make predictions. But yesterday, you published
an article in ""The Guardian"" titled: “Why Putin
has already lost this war.” Please explain. YNH: Well, one thing should be very clear. I don't mean to say that he's going to suffer
an immediate military defeat. He definitely has the military
power to conquer Kyiv and perhaps the whole of Ukraine. Unfortunately, we might see this. But his long-term goal, the whole rationale of the war, is to deny the existence
of the Ukrainian nation and to absorb it into Russia. And to do that, it's not enough
to conquer Ukraine. You also need to hold it. And it's all based
on this fantasy, on this gamble, that most of the population
in Ukraine would agree to this, would even welcome this. And we already know that it's not true. That the Ukrainians
are a very real nation; they are fiercely independent; they don’t want to be part of Russia; they will fight like hell. And in the long-run, again,
you can conquer a country, But as the Russians learned
in Afghanistan, as the Americans learned
also in Afghanistan, also in Iraq, it's much harder to hold a country. And again, the big question mark
before the war was always this. Before the war started,
many things were already known. Everybody knew that the Russian army
is much stronger than the Ukrainian Army. Everybody knew that NATO will not send
armed forces into Ukraine, troops into Ukraine. Everybody knew that the West,
the Europeans, would be hesitant about imposing too strict
a sanction regime for fear of being hurt by it themselves. And this was the basis
for Putin's war plan. But there was one big unknown. Nobody could say for sure
how the Ukrainian people would react. And there was always the option that maybe Putin's fantasy
would come true. Maybe the Russians will march in, Zelenskyy would flee, maybe the Ukrainian army
will just capitulate and the population would not do much. This was always an option. And now we know this was just fantasy. Now we know that the Ukrainians
are fighting, they will fight. And this derails the whole
rationale of Putin’s war. Because you can conquer
the country, maybe, but you won't be able to absorb
Ukraine back into Russia. The only thing he's accomplishing, he is planting seeds of hatred in the hearts of every Ukrainian. Every Ukrainian being killed, every day this war continues
is more seeds of hatred that may last for generations. Ukrainians and Russians
didn't hate each other before Putin. They’re siblings. Now he's making them enemies. And if he continues,
this will be his legacy. BG: We're going to talk a bit
about that again later but, you know, at the same time,
Putin needs a victory, right? The cost, the human, economic,
political cost of this war, not even a week in,
is already astronomical. So to justify it and also
to remain, by the way, a viable leader at the head of Russia, Putin needs to win,
and even win convincingly. So how do we square these things? YNH: I don't know. I mean, the fact that you need to win
doesn't mean that you can win. Lots of political leaders need to win,
and sometimes they lose. He could stop the war,
declare that he won, and say that recognizing
Luhansk and Donetsk by the Russians is what he really wanted all along,
and he achieved this. Maybe they cobble this agreement,
or I don’t know. This is the job of politicians,
I'm not a politician. But I can tell you that I hope,
for the sake of everybody -- Ukrainians, Russians
and the whole of humanity -- that this war stops immediately. Because if it doesn't, it's not only the Ukrainians
and the Russians that will suffer terribly. Everybody will suffer terribly
if this war continues. BG: Explain why. YNH: Because of the shock waves
destabilizing the whole world. Let’s start with the bottom line: budgets. We have been living in an amazing era
of peace in the last few decades. And it wasn't some kind of hippie fantasy. You saw it in the bottom line. You saw it in the budgets. In Europe, in the European Union, the average defense budget of EU members was around three percent
of government budget. And that's a historical miracle, almost. For most of history, the budget of kings and emperors
and sultans, like 50 percent, 80 percent goes to war, goes to the army. In Europe, it’s just three percent. In the whole world, the average
is about six percent, I think, fact-check me on this,
but this is the figure that I know, six percent. What we saw already within a few days, Germany doubles
its military budget in a day. And I'm not against it. Given what they are facing,
it's reasonable. For the Germans, for the Poles, for all of Europe to double their budgets. And you see other countries
around the world doing the same thing. But this is, you know,
a race to the bottom. When they double their budgets, other countries look and feel insecure
and double their budgets, so they have to double
them again and triple them. And the money that should go
to health care, that should go to education, that should go to fight climate change, this money will now go to tanks,
to missiles, to fighting wars. So there is less
health care for everybody, and there is maybe no solution
to climate change because the money goes to tanks. And in this way,
even if you live in Australia, even if you live in Brazil, you will feel the repercussions
of this war in less health care, in a deteriorating ecological crisis, in many other things. Again, another very central
question is technology. We are on the verge,
we are already in the middle, actually, of new technological arms races
in fields like artificial intelligence. And we need global agreement
about how to regulate AI and to prevent the worst scenarios. How can we get a global agreement on AI when you have a new cold war,
a new hot war? So in this field, to all hopes of stopping the AI arms race
will go up in smoke if this war continues. So again, everybody around the world
will feel the consequences in many ways. This is much, much bigger
than just another regional conflict. BG: If one of Putin's goals here
is to divide Europe, to weaken the transatlantic alliance and the global liberal order, he seems to kind of accidentally
have revitalized all of them in a way. US-EU relations have never been
so close in many years. And so how do you read that? YNH: Well, again, in this sense,
he also lost the war. If his aim was to divide
Europe, to divide NATO, he's achieved exactly the opposite. I mean, I was amazed by how quick, how strong and how unanimous
the European reaction was. I think the Europeans
surprised themselves. You even see countries like Finland
and Sweden sending arms to Ukraine and closing their airspace. They didn't even do it in the Cold War. It's really amazing to see it. I think another very important thing
is what has been dividing the West over the several years now, it’s what people term the “culture war”. The culture war between left and right,
between conservatives and liberals. And I think this war can be an opportunity to end the culture war within the West, to make peace in the culture war. First of all, because you suddenly realize
we are all in this together. There are much bigger things in the world than these arguments
between left and right within the Western democracies. And it's a reminder
that we need to stand united to protect Western liberal democracies. But it's deeper than that. Much of the argument
between left and right seemed to be in terms of a contradiction between liberalism and nationalism. Like, you need to choose. And the right goes with nationalism, and the left goes more liberalism. And Ukraine is a reminder that no,
the two actually go together. Historically, nationalism
and liberalism are not opposites. They are not enemies. They are friends, they go together. They meet around the central value
of freedom, of liberty. And to see a nation fighting
for its survival, fighting for its freedom, you see it on Fox News
or you see it in CNN. And yes, they tell the story
a little differently, but they suddenly see the same reality. And they find common ground. And the common ground is to understand that nationalism is not about hating
minorities or hating foreigners, it's about loving your compatriots, and reaching a peaceful agreement about how we want
to run our country together. And I hope that seeing what is happening would help to end
the culture war in the West. And if this happens, we don't need
to worry about anything. You know, when you look
at the real power balance, if the Europeans stick together, if the Americans and
the Europeans stick together and stop this culture war
and stop tearing themselves apart, they have absolutely nothing to fear --
the Russians or anybody else. BG: I'm going to ask you a question later
about the stories the West tells itself, but let me zoom out for a second
and get a larger perspective. You wrote another essay
last week in “The Economist”, and you argue that what's at stake
in Ukraine is, and I quote you, ""the direction of human history"" because it puts at risk what you call the greatest political and moral
achievement of modern civilization, which is the decline of war. So now we are back in a war
and potentially afterwards into a new form of cold war or hot war, but hopefully not. Elaborate about that essay you wrote. YNH: Yeah, I mean, some people think that all this talk
about the decline of war was always just a fantasy. But ... Again, you look at the statistics. Since 1945, there has not been a single clash
between superpowers, whereas previously in history, this was, you know,
the basic stuff of history. Since 1945, not a single internationally
recognized country was wiped off the map
by external invasion. This was the common thing in history. Until then and then it stopped. This is an amazing achievement, which is the basis for everything we have, for our medical services, for education system, and this is all now in jeopardy. Because this era of peace, it wasn't the result of some miracle. It wasn't the result of a change
in the laws of nature. It was humans making better decisions
and building better institutions, which means also that there is no guarantee for the future. If humans, some humans,
start making bad decisions and start destroying
the institutions that kept the peace, then we will be back in the era of war with budgets, military budgets
going to 20, 30, 40 percent. It can happen. It's in our hands. And I'll just say one more thing, When, not just me, but other scholars
like Steven Pinker and others, talked about the era of peace, some people understood it
as kind of encouraging complacency. That, oh, we don't need
to worry about anything. No, I mean, the message
was really the opposite. It was a message of responsibility. If you think that there is no
era of peace in history, it's always war, it's always the jungle, there is a constant level
of violence in nature, then this basically means that there is no point
struggling for peace and there is no responsibility
on leaders like Putin because you can't blame Putin for the war. It's just a law of nature
that there are wars. When you realize, no, humans are able
to decrease the level of violence, then it should make us
much more responsible. And it should also make us understand that the war in Ukraine now,
it’s not a natural disaster. It’s a man-made disaster,
and a single man. It's not the Russian people
who want this war. There's really just a single person who, by his decisions, created this tragedy. BG: So one of the things
that has come back in the last weeks and months
is the nuclear threat. It's moved back into the center
of political and strategic considerations. Putin has talked about it several times, the other day he ordered Russia's
nuclear forces on a higher alert status. President Zelenskyy himself
at the Munich Security Conference essentially said that Ukraine
had made a mistake abandoning the nuclear weapons
it had inherited from the Soviet Union. That's a statement that I suspect
many countries are pondering. What's your thinking about the return
of the nuclear threat? YNH: It's extremely frightening. You know, it's like it's almost Freudian, it's the return of the repressed. We thought that, oh, nuclear weapons, yes, there was something
about that in the 1960s with the Cuban Missile Crisis
and Dr. Strangelove. But no, it's here. And, you know, it took just a few days of difficulties on the battlefield for suddenly -- I mean, I'm watching
television, like, the news and you have these experts
explaining to people what different nuclear weapons will do
to this city or to this country. It rushed back in. So, you know, nuclear weapons are -- in a way they also, until now,
preserved the peace of the world. I belong to the school of thought
that if it was not for nuclear weapons, we would have had the Third World War between the Soviet Union
and the United States and NATO sometime in the 1950s or '60s. That nuclear weapons actually,
until today, served a good function. It's because of nuclear weapons that we did not have any more
direct clashes between superpowers because it was obvious
that this would be collective suicide. But the danger is still there,
it's always there. If there is miscalculation, then the results could, of course, be existential, catastrophic. BG: And at the same time, you know,
in the '70s after Cuba and Berlin, and so in the '60s, but in the '70s, we started building a sort of
international institutional architecture that helped reduce the risk of military
confrontation of nuclear weapons, we used, you know, anything
from arms control agreements to measures designed to build trust
or to communicate directly and so on. And then in the last decade or so, that has been progressively
kind of scrapped, so we are even in a more
dangerous situation than we were let's say,
at the end of the last century. YNH: Completely, I mean, we are now reaping
the bad fruits of neglect that's been going on for several years, not just about nuclear
weapons, but in general, about international institutions
and global cooperation. We’ve built, in the late 20th century, a house for humanity based on cooperation, based on collaboration, based on the understanding that our future depends
on being able to cooperate, otherwise we will become
extinct as a species. And we all live in this house. But in the last few years we stopped -- we neglected it, we stopped repairing it. We allow it to deteriorate more and more. And, you know, eventually it will -- It is collapsing now. So I hope that people will realize
before it's too late that we need not just
to stop this terrible war, we need to rebuild the institutions, we need to repair the global house
in which we all live together. If it falls down, we all die. BG: So we have,
among the audience listening, Rola from -- I don't know where she's from,
she grew up in Lebanon -- and she said, ""I lived the war,
I slept on the ground, I breathed fear. All the reasons were explained to me
that the only remaining learning came the war is absurd. We talk about strategy, power, budgets,
opportunities, technologies. What about human suffering
and psychological trauma?"" Especially, I assume what she's asking
is what about, what's going to remain, in terms of the human suffering and the psychological trauma
going forward? YNH: Yeah, I mean,
these are the seeds of hatred and fear and misery that are being planted right now
in the minds and the bodies of tens of millions,
hundreds of millions of people, really. Because it's not just
the people in Ukraine, it's also in the countries around,
all over the world. And these seeds will give
a terrible harvest, terrible fruits in years,
in decades to come. This is why it's so crucial
to stop the war immediately. Every day this continues,
plants more and more of these seeds. And, you know, like this war now, its seeds were, to a large extent, planted decades and even centuries ago. That part of the Russian fears
that are motivating Putin and motivating people around him is memories of past invasions of Russia, especially, of course,
in Second World War. And of course, it's a terrible mistake what they are doing with it. They are recreating again the same things
that they should learn to avoid. But yes, these are still
the terrible fruits of the seeds being planted in the 1940s. BG: It's what in same article you call the fact that nations
are ultimately built on stories. So these seeds are the stories
we are starting to create now. The war in Ukraine
is starting to create the stories that are going to have an impact
in the future, that's what you're saying. YNH: Some of the seeds of this war
were planted in the siege of Leningrad. And now it gives fruit
in the siege of Kyiv, which may give fruit
in 40 or 50 years in more terrible ... We need to cut this, we need to stop this. You know, as a historian, I feel sometimes ashamed
or responsible, I don't know what, about what history, the knowledge
of history is doing to people. In recent weeks, I have been watching
all the world leaders talking with Putin, and very often he gave them
lectures on history. I think that Macron had a discussion
with him for five hours, and afterwards, said, “Most of the time
he was lecturing me about history.” And as a historian, I feel ashamed that this is what my profession
in some way is doing. I know it for my own country. In Israel, we also suffer
from too much history. I think people should be
liberated from the past, not constantly repeating
it again and again. You know, everybody should
kind of free themselves from the memories of the Second World War. It's true of the Russians, it's also true of the Germans. You know, I look at Germany now, and what I really want to say,
if there are Germans watching us, what I really want to say to the Germans: guys, we know you are not Nazis. You don't need to keep
proving it again and again. What we need from Germany now
is to stand up and be a leader, to be at the forefront
of the struggle for freedom. And sometimes Germans are afraid
that if they speak forcefully or pick up a gun, everybody will say,
""Hey, you're Nazis again."" No, we won't think that. BG: That's happening right now. I mean, lots of things that were
inconceivable just 10 days ago have happened in the last few weeks. And one of the most striking,
to me in any case, is Germany's reaction and transformation. I mean, the new chancellor,
Olaf Scholz, the other day announced that Germany will send arms to Ukraine, and will spend an extra 100 billion
dollars in building up its army. That reverses completely the principles that have guided Germany's foreign policy and security politics for decades. So that shift is happening exactly
at this moment and very, very fast. YNH: Yeah. And I think it's a good thing. We need the Germans to ... I mean, they are now
the leaders of Europe, certainly after Britain left in Brexit. And we need them to, in a way, let go of the past and be in the present. If there is really
one country in the world that, as a Jew, as an Israeli,
as a historian, that I trust it not to repeat
the horrors of Nazism, that's Germany. BG: Yuval, I want to touch
quickly on three things that have to do with the fact
that this feels like the first truly interconnected
war in many ways. The first, of course, is the basics, which is, on one side,
you have a very ancient war -- we have tanks and we have trenches
and we have bombed buildings -- and on the other, we have
real-time visibility of everything through cell phones and Twitter
and TikTok and so on. And you have written a lot
about this tension between old ways and new tech. What's the impact here? YNH: First of all, we don't know
everything that is happening. I mean, surprisingly, with all this
TikTok and phones and everything, so much is not known. So the fog of war is still there, and yes, there is much more information,
but information isn’t truth. Lots of information is disinformation
and fake news and so forth. And yes, it’s always like this; the new and the old, they come together. You know, with all the talk
about interconnectedness and living in cyberspace and all that, one of the most important technologies
not just of this war, but of the last decade or two
have been stone walls. It's Neolithic. Everybody is now building stone walls in the era of Facebook
and Google and all that. So the old and the new, they go together. And it's ... It is a new kind of war. People are sitting at home
in California or Australia, and they actively participate in the war, not just by writing tweets, but by attacking websites
or defending websites. You know, in Spain, in the Civil War, if you wanted to help fight fascism, then you had to go to Spain
and join the international brigade. Now the international brigade
is sitting at home in San Francisco and is still in some way part of the war. So this is definitely new. BG: So indeed, just two days ago,
Ukraine's deputy prime minister, I think, Fedorov, announced via Telegram that he wanted to create
a sort of volunteer cyber army. He invited software developers and hackers and other people with IT skills to somehow help Ukraine
fight on the cyber front. And according to “Wired” magazine,
in less than two days, 175,000 people signed up. So here is a defending nation
that can kind of recruit almost overnight, 175,000 volunteers
to go to battle on his behalf. It's a very different kind of war. YNH: Yeah. You know, every war brings it surprises. Sometimes it's how everything is new, but sometimes it's also
how everything is old. BG: So a few people in the chat
and in the Q and A, have mentioned China, which of course,
is an important actor here, although for now is mostly an observer. But China has a stated policy
of opposing any act that violates territorial integrity. So moving into Ukraine, of course,
violates territorial integrity. And it also has a huge interest
in a stable global economy and global system. But then it needs to square this
with the recent closeness with Russia. Xi Jinping and Putin met in Beijing
before the Olympics, for example, and kind of had this message of friendship
that went out to the world. How do you read China's position
in this conflict? YNH: I don't know, I mean, I'm not an expert on China, and I certainly can't just ... You know, just reading the news
won't get you into the mindset, into the real opinions and positions
of the Chinese leadership. I hope that they take
a responsible position. And act -- because they are close to Russia, they are also close to Ukraine, but especially because
they are close to Russia, they have a lot of influence on Russia, I hope that they will be
the responsible adults that will put down the flames of this war. They have a lot to lose from a breakdown of the global order. And I think they have a lot to win
from the return of peace, including in terms of the gratitude
of the international community. Now, whether they do it or not,
this is with them. I can't predict, but I hope so. BG: You have mentioned before
the several European and Western leaders that have gone to Moscow
in the weeks before the invasion. Varun in the chat, asks, ""Is the Ukraine war
a failure of diplomacy?"" Could have ... Something different happened? YNH: Oh, you can understand it
in two questions. Did diplomacy fail to stop the war? Absolutely, everybody knows that. But is it a failure in the sense
that a different diplomatic approach, some kind of other proposition,
would have stopped the war? I don't know, but it doesn't seem like it. I mean, looking at the events
of the last few weeks, it doesn't seem that Putin
was really interested in a diplomatic solution. It seemed that he was really
interested in the war, and I think, again,
it goes back to this basic fantasy that if he really was concerned
about the security situation of Russia, then there was no need
to immediately invade Ukraine. There was no immediate threat to Russia. There was no discussion of right now,
Ukraine joining NATO. There was no invasion army assembling
in the Baltic states or in Poland. Nothing. Putin chose the moment
to start this crisis. So this is why it doesn't seem that it's really
about the security concerns. It seems more about this very deep fantasy of re-establishing the Russian Empire and of denying the very existence
of the Ukrainian nation. BG: So you live in the Middle East. Someone else in the chat asks, ""What makes the situation so unique compared to many other wars
that are going on right now in the world?"" I would say, aside from the nuclear
threat from Russia, but what else? YNH: Several things. First of all, we have here, again, something
we haven't seen since 1945, which is a dominant power trying to basically
obliterate from the map an independent country. You know, when the US invaded Afghanistan or when the US invaded Iraq, you can say a lot of things about it and criticize it in many ways. There was no question
of the US annexing Iraq or turning Iraq into the 51st state
of the United States. This is what is happening in Ukraine under this pretext or this disguise, this is what's at stake. The real aim is to annex Ukraine. If this succeeds, again, it brings us back
to the era of war. I was struck by what
the Kenyan representative to the UN Security Council said
when this erupted. The Kenyan representative spoke
in the name of Kenya and other African countries. And he told the Russians: Look, we also are the product
of a post-imperial order. The same way the Soviet empire collapsed
into different independent nations, also, African nations came out
of the collapse of European empires. And the basic principle
of African politics ever since then was that no matter what your objections to the borders you have inherited, keep the borders. The borders are sacred because if we start invading
neighboring countries because, ""Hey, this is part of our countries, these people are part of our nation,"" there will not be an end to it. And if this now happens in Ukraine, it will be a blueprint for copycats
all over the world. The other thing which is different
is that we are talking about superpowers. This is not a war
between Israel and Hezbollah. This is potentially a war
between Russia and NATO. And even leaving aside nuclear weapons, this completely destabilizes
the peace of the entire world. And again, I go back again
and again to the budgets. That if Germany doubles
its defense budget, if Poland doubles its defense budget, this will spread to every
country in the world, and this is terrible news. BG: So Yuval, I'm jumping
from topic to topic because I want to use the last few minutes to ask a few questions from the audience. A few people are asking
about the link to the climate crisis, particularly when it relates
to the energy flows. Like, Europe is very dependent, part of Europe, is very dependent
on Russian oil and gas, which is, as far as we know,
still flowing until today. But could this crisis,
in a sort of paradoxical way, a bit like the pandemic,
accelerate climate action, accelerate renewables and and so on? YNH: This is the hope. That Europe now realizes the danger and starts a green Manhattan Project that kind of accelerates
what already has been happening, but accelerates it, the development of better energy sources, better energy infrastructure, which would release it
from its dependence on oil and gas. And it will actually undercut
the dependence of the whole world on oil and gas. And this would be the best way
to undermine the Putin regime and the Putin war machine, because this is what Russia has, oil and gas. That's it. When was the last time you bought
anything made in Russia? They have oil and gas, and we know, you know, the curse of oil. That oil is a source of riches, but it’s also very often
a support for dictatorships. Because to enjoy the benefits of oil, you don't need to share it
with your citizens. You don't need an open society, you don't need education,
you just need to drill. So we see in many places that oil and gas are actually
the basis for dictatorships. If oil and gas, if the price drops, if they become irrelevant, it will not only undercut the finance, the power of the Russian military machine, it will also force Russia, force Putin or the Russians
to change their regime. BG: OK, let me bring up a character that everybody here in the chat
seems to find quite heroic, and that's the Ukrainian president. So Ukraine kind of finds itself with a comedian who turned
almost accidental president, who turned now war president. But he has shown an impressive conduct
in the last few weeks, especially in the last few days, which can be summarized
in that response he gave to the US when they offered
to kind of exfiltrate him so he could lead a government in exile, he said, ""I need ammunition.
I don't need a ride."" How would you look at President Zelenskyy? YNH: His conduct
has indeed been admirable, and he gives courage and inspiration
not just to the Ukrainian people, but I think to everybody around the world. I think to a large extent the swift and united reaction of Europe with the sanctions
and sending arms and so forth, to a large extent, this is also
to the credit of Zelenskyy. That, you know, when politicians are also human beings. And his direct appeal to them, and you know, they met him
many times in person and to see where he is now and the threat that not only him,
but his family is also in. And you know, they talk with him, and he says, and they know,
that this may be the last time they speak. He may be dead, murdered or bombed
in an hour or in a day. It really changes something. So in this sense, I think he made
a huge personal contribution, to not just the reaction in Ukraine,
but around the world. BG: So Sam, who’s listening,
asked this question: ""Can you provide some historical context for the force and the meaning
of economic and trade sanctions at the level where they are
currently imposed. How have previous would-be empires,
would-be aggressors, or aggressors, been constrained by such
isolations and such sanctions?"" YNH: You know, what we need,
again, to realize about Putin's Russia is that it's not the Soviet Union. It's a much smaller and weaker country. It's not like in the 1960s, that in addition to the Soviet Union, you had the entire Soviet bloc around it. So it's easier in this sense
to isolate it. It's much more vulnerable. Again, does it mean that sanctions
would work like a miracle and stop the tanks? No. It takes time. But I think that the West is in a position to impact Russia with these kinds of sanctions
and isolation much more than, let's say, with the Soviet Union. And also the Russian people are different. The Russian people
don't really want this war, even the people in the immediate
circle around Putin. You know, again, I don't know them personally,
from what it seems, it's that these people, they like life. They have their yachts
and they have their private airplanes and they have their house in London and they have their chateau in France. And they like the good life, and they want to keep enjoying it. So I think that the sanctions
can be really effective. What's the timetable? That's ultimately in the hands of Putin. BG: So Gabriella asks: “I remember
the war in former Yugoslavia and the atrocities there. Is there any possibility that this war
would escalate into such a situation?"" I think an extension to that is: Is this war kind of stirring
dormant conflicts like in the Balkans, for example, or in the former Central Asian republic? YNH: Unfortunately, it can get
to that level and even worse. If you want an analogy, go to Syria. You look at what happened in Homs. At what happened in Aleppo. And this was done by Putin
and his airplanes and his minions in Syria. It's the same person behind it. And to think that, ""No, no, no,
this happened in the Middle East. It can't happen in Europe."" No. We could see Kyiv
in the same situation as Homs, as the same situation as Aleppo, which would be catastrophic, and, again, would plant
terrible seeds of hatred for years and decades. So far, we've seen
hundreds of people being killed, Ukrainian citizens being killed. It could reach tens of thousands,
hundreds of thousands. So in this sense, it's extremely
painful to contemplate. And this is why we need again and again to urge the leaders to stop this war, and especially, again and again, tell Putin, ""You will not be able
to absorb Ukraine into Russia. They don't want it, they don't want you. If you continue, the only thing you will achieve
is to create terrible hatred between Ukrainians and Russians
for generations. It doesn't have to be like that."" BG: Yuval, let me finish
with one question about your county. You are in Israel. Israel has close ties
with both Russia and Ukraine. It's actually home of many Russian-born
and many Ukrainian-born Jews. How is the country reacting
to this conflict, I'm talking about the government,
but also about the population? YNH: Actually, I'm not
the best person to ask. I've been so, kind of, following
what's happening around the world, I didn't pay so much attention
to what is happening right here. And even though I live here, I'm not an expert on Israeli society
or Israeli politics. Definitely, the sentiment in the street,
in the social media is with Ukraine. You see Ukrainian flags, you see on social media
people putting Ukrainian flags on their accounts. And another thing,
so many people in Israel, they came from the former Soviet Union. And until now, everybody was simply known as Russians. You know, even if you came from Azerbaijan
or you came from Bukhara, you were a Russian. And suddenly, ""No, no, no, no, no. I'm not Russian. I'm Ukrainian."" And again, these seeds of hatred
that Putin is planting, it's reaching also here. That suddenly people are saying
no, Russian, Ukrainian, until a very short time ago,
it's the same thing. No, it's not the same thing. So the shock waves are spreading. BG: Yuval, thank you for taking the time
and being with us today and sharing your knowledge
and your views on the situation. Thank you very much. YNH: Thank you
and I hope for peace quickly. BG: We all do. Thank you. [Get access to thought-provoking events

The End of Roe v. Wade -- and What Comes Next,Kathryn Kolbert,427430,13961,5419,"Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision protecting people's right to have an abortion in the United States, will be overturned ...","""What's the Supreme Court
going to do about abortion?"" “They’re not really going to overturn
Roe v. Wade, are they?” ""They can't do that, can they?"" I can't tell you how many people
have asked me questions like this in recent months. It makes sense. I have argued two abortion cases
in the US Supreme Court, including the 1992 case
Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which is credited with saving
Roe v. Wade. I was a co-founder of the Center
for Reproductive Rights, and I spent 20 years of my career arguing on behalf of women
who needed abortions and other reproductive health care. So my answer is depressing but direct: Roe v. Wade will be dead within the year. The constitutional right to choose
whether or not to have an abortion will no longer be protected
by the United States Constitution. This court is likely
to overrule Roe and Casey or so undermine its meaning that it will be effectively
unavailable for use. Now I heard your gasps, I'm going to say it again. The Federal Constitution
of the United States will no longer protect
reproductive freedom. Now I'm also here to tell you that there's hope. That we can preserve, by working together, our reproductive freedoms. And by that, I mean more than just
the right to choose abortion. By that, I mean the ability to make
decisions about becoming parents. All people should have that right. Whatever their race,
whatever their gender, whoever they love, all people ought to have the right
to decide to become parents and the social supports that are necessary to raise those children
with dignity and in safety. So opponents argue three things when they say they want to ban abortion. They talk about religion; they talk about protection
of fetal rights; they talk about protection
of women's health. So let's take those each in turn. Religion. You know, the reality of the world is that the world's religions have
a wide variety of views on abortion, and many support them in a whole range
of different circumstances. So when abortion opponents say religion, they're really just imposing
their religion on the rest of us. And what about protection of fetal rights? If in fact you cared
about protecting fetal rights, you'd spend a lot of time
working to eliminate the alarming rate of infant
mortality in this country. (Applause) Because in the United States, we have one of the highest rates
of infant mortality in the developed world. They also should be supporting programs
for children once they are born. (Applause) You know, what about the protection
of women's health? Well, the reality is, abortion is already
an extremely safe surgical procedure. It is safer than childbirth. And imposing new restrictions on abortion
only makes it less safe. In my view, what
we're really talking about, this fixation on abortion by opponents, those people who want to ban abortion, is all about controlling women. And women are unable to operate, to be equal participants in our society, if we cannot control whether,
when and with whom we have children. We cannot exercise
the fundamental human right to make decisions about our bodies
and our destinies. So why am I so convinced that the Supreme Court
is going to overrule Roe and Casey and take what is clearly a radical step? Now, interestingly enough, I learned everything I needed to know
to be successful in the Supreme Court on “Sesame Street.” (Laughter) Why? Because you've got to learn to count. And the only number
that matters is five -- (Laughter) which is a majority
of the justices on the Court. Now, when Casey went
to the High Court in 1992, I was convinced that there were
five justices then prepared to overrule Roe and return to the states
the ability to ban abortion. I was correct. Right after my argument, the justices returned
to their conference room and took a vote, and seven justices voted to uphold
the Pennsylvania restrictions that were at issue in the case. And then Chief Justice Rehnquist
wrote a draft opinion. While he never said the magic words,
that Roe is fatal, as Justice John Paul Stevens recently
wrote in his memoir, the opinion effectively repudiated
the central holding of Roe. Now, luckily, that opinion
was never filed in 1992. At the last minute, Justice Anthony
Kennedy changed his mind, and together with justices
Sandra Day O'Connor and David Souter, they issued what they called
a joint opinion. And in it, they upheld the right of women
to obtain abortion up until viability, usually between 24
and 28 weeks of pregnancy, in all 50 states and US territories. But the Casey decision
went a little further, and it had permitted states
to enact barriers to abortion as long as they weren't undue
burdens on women. And as a result, in the following three decades, we’ve seen states pass
hundreds of restrictions on abortion, and the increasingly conservative
courts uphold those restrictions. And as a result, we've seen a dwindling
availability of abortion. Today, about 11 percent
of the counties in this country that actually have an abortion provider. There are six states
that have one abortion provider. As we know, in the days before Roe, women with means
were able to get abortions. Other women, on the other hand, even today -- low-income women,
women who live in rural areas, teenagers, women of color,
women who are disabled -- all of whom have difficulty accessing safe and affordable abortion. Now the question is:
What’s going to happen now? And unfortunately,
things are going to get worse. There are currently three cases
pending in the Supreme Court, two from Texas and one from Mississippi. Now, most of you probably
have been following the Texas situation. Texas passed a ban on abortion
at about six weeks of pregnancy. It allowed any individual
to sue abortion providers. Vigilantes could collect a bounty
of 10,000 dollars for a violation of the law. And as a result, many, many clinics, probably most of the clinics in Texas, have closed their doors or have decreased the number
of abortions they performed. It's difficult. But the critical piece about Texas is that five justices -- remember that number five -- five justices already voted to permit
the Texas law to go into effect. And besides the harm for women, those justices are not really considering
the constitutionality of the act, only who can be sued and where. The more important case
is out of Mississippi. There, there's a ban on abortion
at 15 weeks of pregnancy. Arguments were heard this week,
and in my view, we are likely to see
at least five justices overrule Roe and Casey and send the question of abortion
back to the states. Sesame Street, five votes. And unfortunately, this time around, there is no Justice Kennedy to save us. Now, what's going to happen
when Roe and Casey are overturned? I'd guess that about half
the states in this country will ban all or most abortions. We're likely to see ban stretching
from Georgia all the way west to Texas, from Idaho, all the way south to Arizona. Women, like Texan women,
will be forced to travel to the 15 states that are controlled by pro-choice
legislators and governors. Other women will seek medication abortion, using the internet
or gray or black markets and subject themselves in some states
to criminal prosecutions. Still, other women will carry
their unintended pregnancies to term. The bottom line is
this is not a pretty picture. So what now? What can we do? We have been saying for five decades, ""Save Roe, save Roe, save Roe."" That strategy is no longer feasible. Give it up. We've got to make sure we quit hitting our heads
against the marble staircase. And try to find new strategies. So I'm going to propose
two of them to you today. First, we’ve got to build
a badass social justice movement. (Applause) Which means loudly crying for our rights, loudly saying: this is something
that belongs to us. We know from watching
the Black Lives Matter movement and the marriage equality movement
that coalition is queen. We've got to find allies and work with them to make sure
our rights are protected. But equally important, we've got to ensure that we elect -- and I'd actually say more important -- is we've got to elect legislators, throughout the states and in Congress, who are champions for reproductive health. Now, I'm not going to bother
to tell you all how to get politically active. This is a crowd that knows how to do it. But knowing how to do it
and actually doing it are two different things, so what you need to do
is get politically active. But one of the things I will tell you is what would our world look like if we were able to wrest the reins
of governmental power away from those who oppose abortion and allow an agenda that reflects reproductive
freedoms and justice. Picture this. We would have childcare and universal childhood education
in every community in this country. We would have paid maternity
and paternity leaves, and people would actually take them. All working parents
ought to have that right. You know -- (Applause) According to the Centers
for Disease Control, African American women, Native American women, Alaska Native women are dying of pregnancy-related causes at three times the rate of white women. And most of those deaths are preventable. So in our world where we control
the reins of power, we would ensure, we would ensure that there were programs to reduce this alarming rate
of maternal mortality. And we would make sure that the systemic racism
in our health care system would be eliminated. And we'd work to eliminate infertility with special programs for women
who can't get pregnant. And we would make sure that all women
are entitled to health care services at all stages of their life. Now all of those things I've talked about, are family-friendly policies and ought to be supported
by our opponents as well. I'll wait to see if that's the case. But in my world where we control
the reins of power, we would do more. The birth control pill
would be available over the counter. (Applause) OK, as easy to get as a bottle of Tylenol. And we'd have quality sex education
in every public school in this country. (Applause) And we would make sure that ... abortion is affordable and available -- no more bans, no more barriers, no more restrictions on funding. And medication abortion, the abortion pill, would be available not just
at Planned Parenthoods and the dwindling number
of abortion clinics in this country, but at pharmacies without a prescription, at walk-in health centers and on every college campus
in the United States. (Applause) And if you had any doubt about the importance
of getting politically active, we could also pass a constitutional amendment, what I call a gender equity amendment, that would guarantee to all persons the ability to make decisions
not just about abortion, but about pregnancy and marriage and sexuality and parenting. And it would be a permanent part
of the United States Constitution. Now the important part of that is these rights should not
be controlled by politicians. They shouldn't be dependent
on where you live or how much money you make or the color of your skin or the person you love or the pronouns you use. These are universal
fundamental human rights, and they ought to be guaranteed in law, in the Constitution, so the Supreme Court
cannot willy-nilly take them away. (Applause) Now to do this, we need to elect champions for choice to the 500,000 elected seats
in our government in this country: everything from school boards
to town councils, to state legislatures
to Congress and the White House. All of those seats need to be controlled
by champions of our cause. And that can only happen
if you get politically active. Your vote, your willingness
to work in campaigns, write postcards, make phone calls, knock on doors, can make that happen. And even run for office, because that's what we need to do. Now while dire, the end of Roe
is not the end of the story. To paraphrase Joan Baez, the best antidote to despair is action. And your action, your willingness to work hard cannot only preserve reproductive
freedoms for ourselves but for our children as well. So let's do it. Thank you. (Cheers and applause)",2021-12-08T16:00:35Z
The art of paying attention,Wendy MacNaughton,272264,6772,143,"In an invitation to slow down and look at the world around you, graphic journalist Wendy MacNaughton illustrates how drawing ...","All right, I'm going to go out
on a limb here. I'm going to say that every single
one of us in this room made drawings when we were little. Yes? Yes? OK. And maybe around the age of like,
four or five or something like that, you might have been drawing, and a grown-up came over
and looked over your shoulder and said, ""What's that?"" And you said, ""It's a face."" And they said, ""That's not really what a face looks like. This is what a face looks like."" And they proceeded to draw this. Circle, two almonds for some eyes, this upside-down seven
situation we have here, and then a curved line. But guess what? This doesn't really look
that much like a face, OK? It's an icon. It's visual shorthand, and it's how we look
at so much of our world today. See, we have so much information
coming at us all the time, that our brains literally
can't process it, and we fill in the world with patterns. Much of what we see
is our own expectations. All right. I'm going to show you a little trick to rewire your brain into looking again. Did you all get an envelope
that says ""do not open"" on it? Grab that envelope, it's time to open it. Inside should be
a piece of paper and a pencil. Once you have that all prepped, please turn to somebody next to you. Ideally, somebody you don't know. Yeah, we're doing this, people, we're doing this. (Laughs) Great. Everybody find a partner? OK, now look back at me. OK, now look back at me. You are going to draw each other, OK? No, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait. I promise this is not
about doing a good drawing, OK? That's not what we're doing here, we're looking, this is about looking. Everybody's going to be terrible,
I promise, don't worry. You're going to draw each other
with two very simple rules. One, you are never going to lift
your pencil up off the paper. One continuous line. No, no, trust me here. This is about looking, OK? So one continuous line
never lift the pencil. Number two, never, ever, ever look down
at the paper you're drawing on, OK? Yes, it's about looking. So keep looking at the person
you're drawing. Now put your pencil down in
the middle of the paper, OK? Look up at your partner. Look at the inside of one of their eyes. Doesn't matter which one. That's where you're going to start. Ready? Deep breath. (Inhales) And begin. Now, just draw but notice where you are, you're starting there
and you see there is a corner, maybe there's a curve there. Notice those little lines, the eyelashes. People are wearing masks,
some aren't, just work with that. Now just go slow. Pay attention and draw what you see. And don't look down. Just keep going. (Murmuring) And just five more seconds. And stop. Look down at your beautiful drawings. (Laughter) Right? Show your partner
their incredible portrait. It's so good, right? I want to see them. Hold them up. Can you guys hold them up? Hold up, everybody. Oh my gosh. Are you kidding me? You all are amazing. OK, you can put your drawings back down, tuck them under, put them on the paper. That was wonderful. I mean, they're all terrible,
but they're wonderful. Why are they wonderful? Because you all just drew a face. You drew what you saw. You didn't draw what you think
a face looks like, right? You also just did something
that people rarely do. You just made intimate eye-to-eye, face-to-face contact with someone
without shying away for almost a minute. Through drawing, you slowed down, you paid attention, you looked closely at someone and you let them look closely at you. Good job. I have found that drawing like this creates an immediate connection
like nothing else. Alright. So I call myself an illustrator
and a graphic journalist. I draw, I tell stories. I spend time with people
looking and listening. And I take the words
of the people that I speak with and I put it together with drawings
that I do, mostly from life, just like you all just did. I found that drawing like this
does a lot of things that photography can't do. So when somebody points
a camera at you, how do you feel? A little objectified, right? When I'm drawing,
I hold my sketchbook low and it keeps an open channel
between me and the person I'm drawing. A lot of time somebody will see me drawing
and they'll get curious. They'll come over to me, and a real, authentic conversation begins. Let me give you an example. So a while back, I wanted to do a drawn story about how the public library
serves our elders. But after spending a few days
kind of lurking around with a sketch pad, looking over older folks' shoulders
and asking them what they were reading, I wasn't really getting the story. Until I stumbled upon Leah. Leah is the first, and at the time
was the only, full-time social worker dedicated to a library in the nation. Turns out, public library
definitely serves our elders. It is also a social service
epicenter of a city. This is Charles. Charles works with Leah. And he does outreach
within the library to folks who are experiencing homelessness. And he took me around, I carried my sketch pad
and I was drawing everything I saw, and he showed me a very different library
than I'd previously seen. So computers that I assumed
were for checking-out books, or, you know, looking at emails, were in fact a lifeline for folks
who are searching for jobs and housing. The sinks in the public restroom, they are a laundromat and showers
for folks who are sleeping on the street. A library is a safe, quiet place where anybody can go and find resources and rest for free. See, the moment I stopped looking
for the story that I expected to see, an entirely new
and richer truth was revealed. I found this to be true with everything
and everyone I've ever drawn. OK, so I draw from life,
right, like you guys did. And so I built myself a mobile studio in the back of a swanky Honda Element -- So that I could go anywhere, talk to anyone at any time and then draw
and paint and sleep in the back. It is very cozy. I was on the road in Utah, drawing and talking to people, when I spotted on the side of the road
a hand-painted wooden sign. It said ""Bootmaker."" I stopped. A tall, white, handlebar mustached man
wearing a cowboy shirt, opened the door and found me, a sketchbook-carrying, jumpsuit-wearing,
urban, lefty lesbian, smiling like, waving like a dork. (Laughter) When I spotted the stuffed cougar
on the wall behind him, this vegetarian thought she knew
all she needed to know about Don the bootmaker. But there we were. So I asked him if he'd just show me
quickly a little bit about his craft. He agreed. And we ended up spending
the whole day together, as I drew out Don in his workshop, and he told me about the sudden death
of his beloved wife, about his deep, deep grief, and about this hunting trip
that he was planning, and so looking forward
to taking with his son. Every tool in that shop held a story. And he was so, so happy to share it with somebody
who was genuinely curious and interested. By the end of the day, Don and I looked
very different to one another. And this drawing, which ended up in my visual column
in the New York Times or as Don likes to call it,
the fake-news media -- (Laughter) now hangs framed on the wall
of his big game trophy room. (Laughter) (Applause) So I was getting ready to start
on a new drawn story when the pandemic hit. And overnight I was, like so many people,
just unable to do my job. It was my own mother who suggested
that I teach drawing to kids. Kids who were about to lose
their routines, be stuck at home, and to help give parents
a much needed short break. Now I'm trained as a social worker, but I'd never taught kids before. But the night before school
closures in San Francisco, I went on Instagram and announced that the next day
we'd try something called DrawTogether. 10 am. I sat behind my drawing table
in my home studio and my wonderful wife
pointed an iPhone at me and pressed ""Go live."" And what I thought would be 100 kids, ended up being 12,000. All eager to draw a dog. The next day, 14,000 kids came and we drew a tree, and that drawing exercise
that you all just did. What was supposed to be
five minutes for five days, ended up being 30 minutes a day, five days a week, for months. And yeah, we talked about line and shape and we learned about perspective and light and shadow. But what was really going on was we were actively looking our way
through a global catastrophe together. See, drawing slows us down. It keeps our hands moving so we can pay attention to things that we usually overlook
or that we ignore. Studies show that drawing
is one of the most effective ways for kids to process their emotions, and that includes trauma. It helps us talk about hard things. We say something in DrawTogether,
it sounds hokey, but it is true. Drawing is looking and looking is loving. If we can give kids the right
supportive environment, drawing helps them let go
of perfectionism and fear of failure so that they, unlike you and me, and especially those of us
who might have freaked out just a wee bit when I said earlier
we were going to draw, right? We can let go of these
harder self-judgments so we don't have to undo
them later in life. OK, I don't expect you all
to become drawers. But I do know that all of us,
kids, grownups, everyone in this room, we can all be better at looking. Because this is not a face. And when we live like this drawing, we miss out on all of the depth
and detail of the world and people around us. This is a face. And this is a face. And that is such a face. (Laughs) And these are faces. And if you slow down, I promise, pay attention and really look. You will fall back in love
with the world and everyone in it. And after the past few years we've had, I think we all desperately need a chance
to look closely at one another and at ourselves, and tell the real truth about what we see. Thank you. (Applause)",2021-11-19T16:00:23Z
How we could eat real meat without harming animals,Isha Datar,105766,3942,677,"What if you could eat chicken nuggets without harming a chicken? It's possible through ""cellular agriculture,"" says Isha Datar.","Diners in Singapore are eating
chicken nuggets made from a chicken who was never killed. How is this possible? Through the power of what I call
""cellular agriculture."" For the past decade, I've been an advocate
for growing meat in a lab. To me, this chicken nugget,
this hamburger, this sausage -- all made from cells instead of animals -- aren’t just fast-food products. They're our ticket to a new food system. Here's how it works. Rather than raise a whole chicken
with beaks, feathers, sentience, we grow the meat directly
from muscle cells. We take a small biopsy
from a living animal, and then extract the cells of interest. They're probably muscle cells, but they could be fat
or connective tissue as well. Now, muscle cells in particular,
love to attach onto surfaces. It helps them grow and elongate
into those long muscle fibers that we're so familiar with. So we might provide
a scaffolding material for those cells to adhere onto. And then, of course, we have to feed
the cells something. So we put them in a liquid medium that provides all the nutrients
that these cells need to grow and divide: carbohydrates, amino acids,
growth factors and more. Lastly, the cells
on the scaffold in the medium all grow within a bioreactor, which is kind of like a large
stainless steel tank -- looks a lot like brewing equipment
and can be just as big as well. And the bioreactor really just provides
that constant stable environment that those cells need to flourish in -- stable temperature, pressure,
inflows, outflows, etc. And after those cells get a chance
to proliferate and differentiate, mature into muscle fibers, we might harvest the cells and the tissues
and then turn them into a nugget, a nugget that was boneless and skinless
and all white meat to begin with. Now, this wouldn't just be better
for chickens and cows and pigs and the people who have to farm them
and slaughter them and process their meat. This could be better for the whole world. Think of this: early estimates of cell-cultured
meat's potential show that cultured meat would require
99 percent less land, 96 percent less water and produce 96 percent fewer
greenhouse gas emissions. Now, those are still speculative
early estimates. But think about the incredible potential
that this technology holds. I mean, if this all works, this would be
a new subsistence strategy, a new tool set for producing food. It wouldn't just be
a new product category. And I think it's our
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get a second chance at agriculture, to do things better
and to learn from our mistakes. What do I mean by mistakes? After all, this is a food system
that keeps billions of people alive, yes. But look at what has happened to chickens in just 50 years. By simply picking which two chickens
to breed with one another, chickens went from this on the left,
a bird that's from 1957, to this on the right, a broiler. These chickens are the same age. Broilers have been optimized so much
for meat production that they must be slaughtered
at six to eight weeks, because if they live beyond that, their legs will not be able
to hold up their bodies. That is real suffering. What about farms? Today, animals are
packed together so closely that the risk of antibiotic resistance
and epidemic viruses are at all-time highs. Did you know that 2018 was the beginning of the largest farmed
animal pandemic ever? African swine fever has already killed
an estimated one in four pigs on Earth. One in four pigs, that is hundreds of millions
of pigs lost from our food supply. Animal agriculture is simply
too big to not fail. What about our changing climate? Did you know that our global herd
of farmed animals is one of the biggest drivers
and victims of climate change? On one hand, cows alone produce nine percent
of all greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, climate chaos is seeing
more and more incidences of thousands, sometimes tens of thousands of cattle being lost overnight in rogue
storms, floods and fires. Farming is always going to be
at the mercy of Mother Nature, but climate change is rewriting
the rules of farming as we speak. We need another way. Lastly, our planet. We dedicate more of this Earth
to feeding cows, pigs and chickens than we do to anything else. About a third of this planet, 27 percent, roughly equivalent to all of North
and South America combined, is dedicated to raising livestock. Now, this could all change
with cellular agriculture. Remember how I said it would
require 99 percent less land to produce cultured meat versus beef? Well, think about it: ranching
can't go vertical, but cell culture can. And if we can alleviate half,
even a quarter, of this land and meet the global demand for protein, well, imagine what we can do
with the rest. Suddenly, it becomes possible
to choose to do things like restore the Amazon rainforest,
which we continue to clear-cut for cattle, or revive other ecosystems that have been
colonized by cows, corn and soy. Or return stolen lands
to Indigenous peoples, who can finally reclaim
their ancestral foodways. The United Nations says that
we will have to restore nature on land the size of China if we are to achieve climate resilience. Cellular agriculture actually
puts this on the table. Not only could we alleviate
land for restoration, we can also create the products we know
and love at a fraction of the emissions. By farming cells, we could actually
proactively envision agriculture for a climate-changed world. And it’s not just meat. Actually, by engineering biology, we could theoretically grow anything
that might come from plants or animals from cells instead. Vanilla doesn’t have to be
rainforest farmed. Egg whites don’t have to come
with a yolk. Foie gras can be completely cruelty-free, and leather and silk don't
have to come off the back of an animal or the home of a silkworm. In fact, we already consume
cellular agriculture products in our everyday lives, just in supersmall quantities. Several vitamins, flavors and enzymes
are already made in cell cultures. In fact, rennet, which is
the set of enzymes used to turn milk into curds and whey
for cheese-making, used to come from the stomach lining
of the fourth stomach of calves, baby cows. And in 1990, a cell-cultured
version hit the market. A version of the key enzyme, chymosin. And today, only 30-ish years later, 90 percent of rennet
used for cheese-making came from a bioreactor instead of a calf. Now, imagine what might happen if we expand beyond these small-volume,
high-value products like rennet into commodity-level products like milk. Well, it's getting started. Today, you can buy ice cream --
real dairy ice cream -- that was produced by cellular agriculture. This is cows milk that never
came from a cow. It came from a computer. The gene for whey protein was looked up
in an open-source database, printed and then inserted into the DNA
of an organism called trichoderma. Now, just like in brewing,
where we feed sugar to yeast to brew alcohol in a big
stainless steel fermenter, we feed sugar to this
modified trichoderma and out comes whey proteins
that we can put in yogurt, cream cheese and ice cream. Now, I have to admit that maybe
this is the easy stuff, relatively speaking. I mean, we have been modifying
microorganisms to make proteins for us for decades now. And tissue engineering, which is what
would be needed for meat production, is a lot newer science. I mean, animal cells are just a lot more
finicky than microbes in cell culture, and growing a lot of animal cells
and achieving three dimensionality is just no easy feat. But we're getting there. Back in 2013, it cost 250,00 euros
to produce this hamburger, and today, I've seen estimates
of cell-cultured meats cost as low as $50 per pound. That's one twenty-seven-thousandth
of what it was less than a decade ago. And I can really only see the price
of cultured meat coming down, and I can only see the price of meat
from animals going up. I mean, think about it --
we’re still in the early days of R and D. As scientific breakthroughs are made, like recycling growth medium,
reducing the cost of growth factors and achieving higher
cell density in vitro, this curve is still going to go down. Meanwhile, the price of meat from animals
is already artificially low due to heavy subsidization. It does not reflect
the cost to the public health or to the environment. And, in a world changed by COVID,
African swine fever and a changing climate, the price of meat from animals
can only go up. In fact, I think that price parity would
be well within reach if it were an even playing field. On one hand, we have animal agriculture, which is so heavily supported by public
funding and government support. On the other hand, we have
this very promising technology, which requires very intensive R and D and needs a lot of infrastructure
and training support but is left entirely in the hands
of the private sector and market forces. In fact, I don't think any
of the wonderful things I just described about rewilding
the Amazon and so on will happen if we leave this technology
solely in the hands of technology and market forces. There's a real chance that cellular
agriculture could fail, and it won't be because
the science doesn't add up. It'll be because we didn't think about
what ownership should look like or IP protection or governance or policy -- you know, the business side
of mission-driven businesses. And we're going to have to be
very careful and thoughtful about what this technology
needs around it so we can maximize the positive impact
that it will have on this world. Look, I'm here today because
animal products are just amazing, and you would be hard-pressed
to find proteins in the plant world that can do what animal proteins can do: long, stretchy cheeses,
creamy custards, fluffy meringues, the incredibly rich umami flavors
that you can find in meat and seafood ... But despite how amazing
animal proteins are, they just don't need to come
from animals anymore. And yes, we've got a long way to go to realize the potential
of this technology, and it's going to take ingenuity both
inside of the lab and outside of it, too. But think about what we get in return. We get a chance to usher in
a transformation as big for humanity as our transformation from hunting
to agriculture some 12,000 years ago. This could be a new era of abundance
in so many different ways. I'm personally most selfishly excited
for the food products that I can't even fathom today, because this is really a new tool
for culinary creativity as well. I mean, we haven't really seen this since our ancestors discovered
fermentation a while back. What I mean by that is, we could have never looked at a glass
of milk before we fermented foods and wanted it to be hard
and stinky and moldy. You know, we could have
never envisioned cheese or the hundreds of varieties
of cheese that we have today. Similarly, meat is still defined
by the body of an animal. We still describe it as cuts of meat. But if we can grow meat from cells, suddenly the boundaries for what meat
can be will totally change. Meat could be thin and translucent. It could be liquid. It could be crunchy, it could be bubbly. Burgers are the baseline and sausages
are just a starting point, and nuggets are nowhere near
what's possible with cellular agriculture. Let's dream up a bigger, bolder
future of food. Thank you. (Applause)",2021-10-22T14:30:01Z
How Every Child Can Thrive by Five,Molly Wright,7978171,286373,0,"""What if I was to tell you that a game of peek-a-boo could change the world?"" asks seven-year-old Molly Wright, one of the ...","Transcriber: Ivana Korom
Reviewer:  [Baby cooing] What if I was to tell you that a game of peekaboo
could change the world? Sounds impossible, right? Well, I’m here today to prove it’s not. Hi, I’m Molly and I’m seven. And this is my little friend, Ari. Say “Hi,” Ari. Hi. Oh, and this is my neighbor, Amarjot. He has to take Ari away now
to get ready for our experiment. But don't worry, they'll be back. My talk today is about some powerful
things you grownups can do. that shape us as children
and the adults we become. How do I know? Because my parents and people around me
did them early and often. I know not all kids are as lucky. Some of my friends, some kids at my school
and many around the world. And I would really like
to help change that. Thanks to scientists, we now know just how important
the first five years are for our health and development, especially our brains. Ari started learning
long before he was even born, from inside his mommy’s tummy. When Ari was born, he was tiny and he cried all the time. He was always hungry
and he pooped a lot. [Laughter] Now he laughs and giggles
and makes funny noises. But those are just the changes
we hear and see. That’s way more going on inside. So, let’s talk more about our brains. The blue bag is a rough size and weight
of a healthy baby’s brain at birth. The red one is a baby’s brain
after the first year. It almost doubles in volume. And by my age, it's almost 90 percent
the volume of an adult brain. Our brains develop faster
in our early years than at any other time 
in our lives. It can create up to one million
neural connections every second. But we need your help. Our healthy development depends
on these top five things, One, connecting; two, talking; three, playing; four, a healthy home, five; community. All of this helps our brains
and us reach our full potential. So what’s something you can do
that can really make a difference? Scientists call it serve and return. That’s just a grown-up way of saying
connect, talk and play with us. And here’s the really big news. Amarjot, Ari, you ready? (Audio) Amajat: Ready? Molly Wright: Copycat games
build imagination and empathy. (Amarjot and Ari laughing) Naming games build vocabulary
and attention. Amarjot: Daddy. Ari. Daddy. Ari. MW: And games like peekabo --
yep, peekaboo -- actually build memory and trust. Amarjot: Peekaboo! MW: Each time you talk to us,
play with us, make us laugh, it not only builds and strengthens
our relationships and mental health, it actually teaches us
some of the most important life skills, from making friends to taking the test, to getting a job, to one day maybe even starting
a family of our own. Interactions early and often matter. Take it from me, the seven-year-old up here
talking about brain science. (Laughter) OK, now let’s see what happens
when the connection is taken away. So now he’s trying to get
his dad’s attention again. He’s reaching out like,
“That was fun, why have you stopped?” (Ari cries) I know it’s important for adults
to use their devices sometimes, but kids are hardwired
to seek out meaningful connections, not receiving them
causes confusion and stress. OK, Amarjot, please re-engage. Amarjot: Ah, there’s Ari. (Ari laughs) MW: Now what if our whole childhood
was like that last 30 seconds? How hard it would be
for a child to feel calm. To feel safe. To learn to trust anyone. And the lifelong impact that would have. That makes me feel sad. Ari only reacted the way he did
and recovered so quickly because the connection between him
and his dad is usually so strong. The positive relationships
with the grown-ups in our lives gives kids the confidence we need to try new things, to explore 
and be a kid. So please, try to remember the most special period
for our development is the first five years. Starting from inside mommy’s tummy. What’s something really
impactful you can do? Serve and return. And when? Early and often. Please give it up for a Amarjot and Ari. (Applause) Every moment together is an opportunity to connect, talk and play. Imagine the difference we could make
if everyone everywhere did this. To us, the children, it’s so much more than just a game. It's our future. Thank you. (Applause) See? Peekaboo really can change the world. (Applause)",2021-08-09T15:00:01Z
I let algorithms randomize my life for two years,Max Hawkins,241727,10364,516,What if everything in your life was randomized: from the food you ate to the things you did and the places you traveled? Computer ...,"I used to love waking up
at exactly 7:00am. When I lived in San Francisco, I would wake up right at 7:00am and immediately go
to my favorite coffee shop. It was my favorite coffee shop,
because it was the best coffee shop. I had done the research,
it was five stars, it was great. And I would drink my coffee and get onto my bicycle
and ride into work. And I had optimized
my schedule to be perfect. I was constantly, like,
shaving off one or two seconds making it slightly faster so I could get into work faster. I was working as a software
engineer at Google, and in a lot of ways, this was my dream job. It felt like this was the thing that the rest of my life
was leading up towards. I'd always wanted to work in software and I was finally doing it. And I was living in San Francisco, which is a city that I love, surrounded by people who were like me. And every part of my life
was perfectly tailored to my interests, the things that I wanted to do. And I loved it. So one day I was at work
and I started to read this paper, a computer science research paper
about predictive analytics. And the gist of the paper was that if you take someone's GPS trace, like the listing of all the places
that they've been in the past month or so, and you feed it into
a machine-learning algorithm, you can predict with fairly high accuracy where they're going to be
on the following day. And I thought this was kind of cool. And I was thinking, like, what would happen if you put
my GPS trace into the algorithm? What would come out the other end? So I was talking with my friend Kelly, and we were planning
something to do after work that day. And I got onto Yelp
and found this really great bar that had just opened up. And I was about to suggest
that we go to this bar when I stopped. And I started thinking
about that algorithm again. And I started thinking, wait a second, isn't this bar exactly where
that algorithm would guess that I was going to go this evening? And that was kind of weird. Because I thought that I ... where was I in that? I know that I was the one
making the choice, right? But how did the computer
know about that? So that was a little disturbing. And since I'm an engineer,
whenever I have a problem like this, my instinct is to fix it, to make something that solves the problem. And so I decided to make an app that would help me choose
where to go on this evening. And so the way that it works is that the app looks at all the places that are on Google maps
in the city of San Francisco, and then chooses one at random. And then it calls an Uber. And that car shows up at your location and takes you to that random place. It tells the Uber driver
where the random place is, but tells you nothing. And so it's a big surprise
when you arrive. (Laughter) And so I texted Kelly and I said,
""We should do this."" We met up and pressed the button. And suddenly, miraculously, there was an Uber driver
at my apartment door. So we got in and very quickly started heading
to a part of San Francisco that neither of us really knew. It was a part of town that we
just had never been in before. And when the driver told us
we had reached our destination, we thought it must have been a joke. We showed up in front
of this austere brick building with a wrought iron fence in front of it, and a sign that said the words San Francisco General Hospital,
Psychiatric Emergency Center. (Laughter) Which, maybe that's pretty appropriate, I don't know. (Laughter) But we thought it was funny. But it was also exhilarating because here we were, in this place that we never
would have gone to otherwise, doing something really different
on a Friday night. (Laughter) And I was hooked, I started using this app to go to all different places
in San Francisco. I went to museums randomly, random grocery stores,
random bars, random bowling alleys, random florists. And I started discovering that there was an entire side
to San Francisco that I had been ignoring
because of my preference. And then I started thinking, how else can I apply
this concept to my life? And so I started building other
experiments that involved randomness. I made a random
YouTube video generator, a random schedule generator, a random diet club that would randomly eliminate a food
from my diet each week. (Laughter) And it's cumulative,
so eventually you just can't eat. (Laughter) Random tattoo generator, a random Spotify playlist, random podcast, a printer that prints out
random suggestions of things to do. (Laughter) A random Facebook event generator. And the way that this one works is that in a city like Vienna
on a given day, there are hundreds of Facebook events -- public Facebook events --
that are going on. So it would choose one at random and say, this is your plan for tonight. And so I ended up showing -- (Laughter) And so I'd show up
at events like Joe's birthday, the eighth grade band recital,
chess club, truck drivers school. And it was really interesting because these were communities
that I knew nothing about but were having amazing events to talk about things
that they cared about. And there I was. After a while, I had the opportunity
to transition my work into freelance, which gave me a lot more flexibility
about where I lived. And so I decided, you know, what if I could let
the computer decide what part of the world I lived in? And so I wrote a program that figured out every city that it was possible
for me to live in, given my budget, and then chose one at random. And I started living this way and it sent me all over the world. Taipei, Taiwan, Mumbai, India, Dubai. Even places that for an American
are really off the beaten path, like Essen, Germany and Gortina, Slovenia. And every time I would go to a new city, I would do the same sort of stuff
I was doing in San Francisco, go to random events, meet random people. And I'd live there for two to three months and then ask the computer again
for the next location. I did this for two years. Paradoxically, giving up
control to this machine actually made me feel more free
than when I was making choices, because I discovered that ... My preference had blinded me
from the complexity and the richness of the world. And following the computer
gave me the courage to live outside of my comfort zone, to discover parts of the human
experience that I ignored because they were too different or not for me. I ended up in Mumbai, India for a while, and I was going to a lot
of Facebook events when I was there. And one day, the computer
sent me to this yoga class and I'm really bad at yoga, but I went anyway. I found myself descending
into a downward dog when I had a revelation. Because I was thinking about, you know, this random stuff is really freeing, it's sort of putting me
outside of my bubble, my comfort zone. But really how random is it? Because this was not my first
yoga event in Mumbai. In fact, it was my third that week. (Laughter) And if you think about it, it's not surprising
that you see patterns like this. Because I was choosing randomly from a list of things
that was decidedly not random. The list of Facebook events
that are happening in a city is very influenced by the things
that are going on in a city like that. And if you think about it,
every time you make a choice, you're not just making it on your own. You're selecting from a list, a menu of choices that was designed
by someone or something else. And whatever freedom
that you have in that choice is necessarily constrained
by social structures, customs and history that provide the context
for that selection. So initially, I thought of this
as a way of getting outside of my bubble. As, you know, transcending
myself, my preference. But eventually I started
to think about it differently. I started to think about it
as a way of taking a photograph. When I was in a place like Mumbai, it was more likely that I would
show up at a yoga event. But if I was in Vienna, maybe a music event would be more likely. Every time that I was choosing
randomly in a city, what I was doing
was making an inquiry, asking, ""Mumbai, tell me what you're about."" And then the answer would tell me
something about the structure of that city and my relationship to it and its relationship
with the rest of the world. And so I ... I had, like, a really tidy ending
for this previously. And as I was coming up here,
I decided to scrap it, because ... You know, I think that, like,
a problem with TED Talks often is that they wrap up in a tidy bow and then you can go away
without really thinking about it. You can sort of just -- It feels like everything is OK at the end. And I think ... In the world that we're living in, there are a lot of real problems. And I think that these questions
of algorithmic control play a lot into them. We're talking right now about the role that Facebook had
in the American election. There are a lot of questions about the ways that these algorithms
are controlling our lives. And so, I don't know, I don't know what I'm saying and I don't have, like,
a very clear conclusion. But I would just encourage you
to try to be experimental when it comes to interacting
with these algorithms. Because if you just do the defaults, follow your preference, go in the direction
that everything else is going, it's really easy to get caught
in a place where you can be controlled. And I think that's it. Thank you. (Applause)",2021-03-13T01:29:29Z
Using your voice is a political choice,Amanda Gorman,413218,12077,643,"For anyone who believes poetry is stuffy or elitist, Amanda Gorman -- the youngest inaugural poet in US history -- has some ...",[Music] [Applause] i have two questions for you one whose shoulders do you stand on and two what do you stand for these are two questions that i always begin my poetry workshops with students because at times poetry can seem like this dead art form for like old white men who just seem like they were born to be old like you know benjamin button or something and i asked my students these two questions and then i share how i answer them which is in these three sentences that go i am the daughter of black writers were descended from freedom fighters who broke their chains and changed the world they call me and these are words i repeat in a mantra before every single poetry performance in fact i was like doing it in the corner over there i was like making faces um and so i repeat them to myself as a way to gather myself because i'm not sure if you know but public speaking is pretty terrifying um i know i'm on stage and i have my heels i look all glam but i'm horrified um and the way in which i kind of strengthen myself is by having this mantra most of my life i was particularly terrified of speaking up because i had a speech impediment which made it difficult to pronounce certain letters sounds and i felt like i was fine writing on the page once i got on stage i was worried my words might jumble and stumble what was the point in trying not to mumble these thoughts in my head if everything's already been said before but finally i had a moment of realization where i thought if i choose not to speak out of fear then there's no one that my silence is standing for and so i came to realize that i cannot stand standing to the side standing silent i must find the strength to speak up and one of the ways i do that is through this mantra where i call back to what i call honorary ancestors these are people who might not be related to you by blood or by birth but who are more than worth saying their names because you stand on the shoulders all the same and it's only from the height of these shoulders that we might have the sight to see the mighty power of poetry the power of language made accessible accessible poetry is interesting because not everyone is going to become a great poet but anyone can be and anyone can enjoy poetry and it's this openness this accessibility of poetry that makes it the language people poetry has never been the language barriers it's always been the language of bridges and it's this connection making that makes poetry yes powerful but also makes it political one of the things that irritates me to no end is when i get that phone call and it's usually from a white man and he's like man amanda we love your poetry we'd love to get you to write a poem about this subject but don't make it political which to me sounds like i have to draw a square but not make it a rectangle or like build a car and not make it a vehicle it doesn't make much sense because all art is political the decision to create the artistic choice to have a voice the choice to be heard is the most political act of all and by political i mean poetry is political at least three ways one what stories we tell when we're telling them how we're telling them if we're telling them why we're telling them so so much about the political beliefs we have about what types of stories matter secondly who gets to have those stories told i'm talking who is legally allowed to read who has the resources to be able to write who are we reading in our classrooms says a lot about the political and educational systems that all these stories and storytellers exist in lastly poetry is political because it's preoccupied with people if you look in history notice that tyrants often go after the poets and the creatives first they burn books they try to get rid of poetry in the language arts because they're terrified of them poets have this phenomenal potential to connect the beliefs of the private individual with the cause of change of the public the population the polity the political movement and when you leave here i really want you to try to hear the ways in which poetry is actually at the center on our most political questions about what it means to be a democracy maybe later you're going to be at a protest and someone's gonna have a poster that says they buried us but they didn't know we were seeds that's poetry you might be in your u.s history class and your teacher may play a video of martin luther king jr saying we will be able to hew out of this mountain of despair a stone of hope that's poetry or maybe even here in new york city you're going to go visit the statue of liberty where there's a sonnet that declares as americans give us you're tired you're poor your huddled masses yearning to be free so you see when someone asks me to write a poem that's not political what they're really asking me is to not ask charged and challenging questions in my poetic work and that does not work because poetry is always at the pulse of the most dangerous and the most daring questions that a nation or world might face what path do we stand on as a people and what future as a people do we stand for and the thing about poetry is that it's not really about having the right answers it's about asking these right questions about what it means to be a writer doing right by your words and your actions and my reaction is to pay honor to those shoulders of people who use those pens to roll over boulder so i might have a mountain of hope on which to stand so that i might understand the power of telling stories that matter no matter what so that i might realize that if i choose not out of fear but out of courage to speak then there's something unique that my words can become and all of a sudden that fear that my words my jumble and stumble go away as i'm humbled by the thoughts of thousands of stories a long time coming that i know are strumming inside me as i celebrate those people in their time who stood up so this little black girl could vine as i celebrate and call their names all the same these people who seemed like they were just born to be bold maya angelou and ozaki shanghai phyllis wheatley lucille clifton gwendolyn brooks joan wicks audrey lord and so many more it might feel like every story has been told before but the truth is no one's ever told my story in the way i would tell it as the daughter of black writers who were descended from freedom fighters who broke their chains and changed the world they call me i call them and one day i'll write a story right by writing it into tomorrow on this earth more than worth standing for,2021-01-20T14:29:49Z
The beautiful balance between courage and fear,Cara E. Yar Khan,211000,4747,152,"After being diagnosed with a rare genetic condition that deteriorates muscle, Cara E. Yar Khan was told she'd have to limit her ...","When we're young, we're innocently brave, and we fearlessly dream
about what our lives might be like. Maybe you wanted to be an astronaut
or a rocket scientist. Maybe you dreamed
of traveling to every continent. Since I was very young, I dreamed of working
for the United Nations in some of the most difficult
countries in the world. And thanks to a lot of courage that dream came true. But here's the thing about courage: it doesn't just appear
whenever we need it. It's the result of tough
reflection and real work, involving the balance
between fear and bravery. Without fear, we'll do foolish things. And without courage,
we'll never step into the unknown. The balance of the two
is where the magic lies, and it's a balance
we all deal with every day. First, a word about my fancy wheels. I haven't always used a wheelchair. I grew up like many of you, running, jumping and dancing. I love to dance. However, in my mid-twenties, I began to experience
a series of inexplicable falls. And a few years later, I was diagnosed with a recessive
genetic condition called hereditary inclusion body myopathy, or HIBM. It's a progressive muscle wasting disease that affects all of my muscles
from head to toe. HIBM is very rare. In the United States there are
less than 200 people diagnosed. To date, there is
no proved treatment or cure, and within 10 to 15 years of its onset, HIBM typically leads to quadriplegia, which is why I now use a wheelchair. When I was first diagnosed,
everything changed. It was frightening news because I had no experience
with chronic illness or disabilities. And I had no idea
how the disease might progress. But what was most disheartening was to listen to other people advise me to limit my ambitions and dreams, and to change my expectations
of what to expect from life. ""You should quit
your international career."" ""No one will marry you this way."" ""You would be selfish to have children."" The fact that someone who wasn't me was putting limitations
on my dreams and ambitions was preposterous. And unacceptable. So I ignored them. (Cheers and applause) I did get married. And I decided for myself
not to have children. And I continued my career
with the United Nations after my diagnosis, going to work for two years in Angola, a country recovering
from 27 years of brutal civil war. However, it would be another five years until I officially declared
my diagnosis to my employer. Because I was afraid that they would question my capacity
to manage and I'd lose my job. I was working in countries
where polio had been common, so when I overheard someone say that they thought
I might have survived polio, I thought my secret was safe. No one asked why I was limping. So I didn't say anything. It took me over a decade to internalize the severity of HIBM, even as basic tasks and functions
became increasingly difficult. Yet, I continued to pursue my dream
of working all over the world, and was even appointed
as a disability focal point for UNICEF in Haiti, where I served for two years
after the devastating 2010 earthquake. And then my work brought me
to the United States. And even as the disease
progressed significantly and I needed leg braces
and a walker to get around, I still longed for adventure. And this time, I started dreaming
of a grand outdoor adventure. And what's more grand
than the Grand Canyon? Did you know that for every
five million people who visit the Rim only one percent go down
to the canyon's base? I wanted to be a part of that one percent. The only thing is -- (Applause) The only thing is that the Grand Canyon
isn't exactly accessible. I was going to need some assistance to get down the 5,000-foot descent
of vertical loose terrain. Now, when I face obstacles, fear doesn't necessarily
immediately set in because I assume that one way or another, I'll figure it out. And in this case, my thought was, well, if I can't walk down, I could learn to ride a horse. So that's what I did. And with that fateful decision began a four-year commitment, tossing back and forth
between fear and courage to undertake a 12-day expedition. Four days on horseback
to cross Grand Canyon rim to rim, and eight days rafting
150 miles of the Colorado River, all with a film crew in tow. Spoiler alert -- we made it. But not without showing me
how my deepest fear can somehow manifest
a mirror response of equal courage. On April 13, 2018, sitting eight feet above the ground, riding a mustang horse named Sheriff, my first impression of Grand Canyon was one of shock and terror. Who knew I had a fear of heights. (Laughter) But there was no giving up now. I mustered up every ounce
of courage inside me to not let my fear get the best of me. Embarking on the South Rim, all I could do to keep myself composed was to breathe deeply,
stare up into the clouds and focus on my team's voices. But then, in the first hour,
disaster struck. Unable to hold myself
upright in the saddle, going down an oversized step, I flung forward and smacked my face
on the back of the horse's head. There was panic, my head hurt fiercely, but the path was too narrow
for us to dismount. Only at the halfway point at 2,300 feet, at least another two hours down, could we stop and remove my helmet and see the egg-sized bump
protruding from my forehead. For all of that planning and gear, how is it that we didn't
even have an ice pack? (Laughter) Luckily for all of us,
the swelling came outwards, and would drain into my face
as two fantastic black eyes which is an amazing way to look
in a documentary film. (Laughter) (Applause and cheers) This was not an easy, peaceful journey, and yet, that was exactly the point. Even though I was afraid
to get back into the saddle, I got back in. The descent alone to the canyon floor took a total of 10 hours and that was just day one of four riding. Next came the mighty rapids. The Colorado River in the Grand Canyon has some of the highest
white water in the country. And just to be prepared
in case we should capsize, we'd practice having me swim
through a smaller rapid. And it's safe to say it wasn't glamorous. (Laughter) I took my breath
in the wrong part of the wave, choked on river water and was unable to steer myself. Yes, it was scary, but it was also fantastic. Waterfalls, slick canyons and a couple billion years of bedrock that seemed to change color
throughout the day. The Grand Canyon is true wilderness and worthy of all of its accolades. (Applause) The expedition, all that planning and the trip itself, showed me a level of fear
I had never experienced before. But more importantly, it showed me how boldly
courageous I can be. My Grand Canyon journey was not easy. This was not a vision
of an Amazonian woman effortlessly making her way
through epic scenery. This was me crying, exhausted and beat up with two black eyes. It was scary, it was stressful, it was exhilarating. Now that the trip is over, it's easy to be blasé
about what we achieved. I know I want to raft the river again. This time, all 277 miles of it. (Applause) But I also know that I would never do
the horseback-riding part again. (Laughter) It's just too dangerous. And that's my real point. I'm not just here
to show you my film footage. I'm here to remind us all that life is really just a lesson in finding the balance
between fear and courage. And understanding what is
and what isn't a good idea. (Laughter) Life is already scary, so for our dreams to come true,
we need to be brave. In facing my fears and finding the courage
to push through them, I swear my life has been extraordinary. So live big and try to let your courage
outweigh your fear. You never know where it might take you. Thank you. (Applause and cheers)",2020-01-22T17:03:29Z
How changing your story can change your life,Lori Gottlieb,3496368,76604,1224,"Visit http://TED.com to get our entire library of TED Talks, transcripts, translations, personalized Talk recommendations and more.","I'm going to start
by telling you about an email that I saw in my inbox recently. Now, I have a pretty unusual inbox because I'm a therapist and I write an advice column
called ""Dear Therapist,"" so you can imagine what's in there. I mean, I've read thousands
of very personal letters from strangers all over the world. And these letters range
from heartbreak and loss, to spats with parents or siblings. I keep them in a folder on my laptop, and I've named it
""The Problems of Living."" So, I get this email,
I get lots of emails just like this, and I want to bring you
into my world for a second and read you one of these letters. And here's how it goes. ""Dear Therapist, I've been married for 10 years and things were good
until a couple of years ago. That's when my husband
stopped wanting to have sex as much, and now we barely have sex at all."" I'm sure you guys were not expecting this. (Laughter) ""Well, last night I discovered
that for the past few months, he's been secretly having
long, late-night phone calls with a woman at his office. I googled her, and she's gorgeous. I can't believe this is happening. My father had an affair
with a coworker when I was young and it broke our family apart. Needless to say, I'm devastated. If I stay in this marriage, I'll never be able
to trust my husband again. But I don't want to put our kids
through a divorce, stepmom situation, etc. What should I do?"" Well, what do you think she should do? If you got this letter, you might be thinking
about how painful infidelity is. Or maybe about how especially
painful it is here because of her experience
growing up with her father. And like me, you'd probably
have some empathy for this woman, and you might even have some, how should I put this nicely, let's just call them ""not-so-positive""
feelings for her husband. Now, those are the kinds of things
that go through my mind too, when I'm reading
these letters in my inbox. But I have to be really careful
when I respond to these letters because I know that every letter I get
is actually just a story written by a specific author. And that another version
of this story also exists. It always does. And I know this because if I've learned
anything as a therapist, it's that we are all unreliable
narrators of our own lives. I am. You are. And so is everyone you know. Which I probably shouldn't have told you because now you're not
going to believe my TED Talk. Look, I don't mean
that we purposely mislead. Most of what people tell me
is absolutely true, just from their current points of view. Depending on what
they emphasize or minimize, what they leave in, what they leave out, what they see and want me to see, they tell their stories
in a particular way. The psychologist Jerome Bruner
described this beautifully -- he said, ""To tell a story is, inescapably,
to take a moral stance."" All of us walk around
with stories about our lives. Why choices were made,
why things went wrong, why we treated someone a certain way -- because obviously, they deserved it -- why someone treated us a certain way -- even though, obviously, we didn't. Stories are the way
we make sense of our lives. But what happens when the stories we tell are misleading or incomplete
or just wrong? Well, instead of providing clarity, these stories keep us stuck. We assume that our circumstances
shape our stories. But what I found time and again in my work is that the exact opposite happens. The way we narrate our lives
shapes what they become. That's the danger of our stories, because they can really mess us up, but it's also their power. Because what it means
is that if we can change our stories, then we can change our lives. And today, I want to show you how. Now, I told you I'm a therapist, and I really am, I'm not being
an unreliable narrator. But if I'm, let's say, on an airplane, and someone asks what I do, I usually say I'm an editor. And I say that partly
because if I say I'm a therapist, I always get some awkward response, like, ""Oh, a therapist. Are you going to psychoanalyze me?"" And I'm thinking, ""A : no, and B: why would I do that here? If I said I was a gynecologist, would you ask if I were
about to give you a pelvic exam?"" (Laughter) But the main reason I say I'm an editor is because it's true. Now, it's the job of all therapists
to help people edit, but what's interesting
about my specific role as Dear Therapist is that when I edit,
I'm not just editing for one person. I'm trying to teach a whole group
of readers how to edit, using one letter each week as the example. So I'm thinking about things like, ""What material is extraneous?"" ""Is the protagonist moving forward
or going in circles, are the supporting characters important
or are they a distraction?"" ""Do the plot points reveal a theme?"" And what I've noticed is that most people's stories
tend to circle around two key themes. The first is freedom, and the second is change. And when I edit, those are the themes that I start with. So, let's take a look
at freedom for a second. Our stories about freedom go like this: we believe, in general, that we have an enormous
amount of freedom. Except when it comes
to the problem at hand, in which case, suddenly,
we feel like we have none. Many of our stories
are about feeling trapped, right? We feel imprisoned
by our families, our jobs, our relationships, our pasts. Sometimes, we even imprison ourselves
with a narrative of self-flagellation -- I know you guys all know these stories. The ""everyone's life
is better than mine"" story, courtesy of social media. The ""I'm an impostor"" story,
the ""I'm unlovable"" story, the ""nothing will ever
work out for me"" story. The ""when I say, 'Hey, Siri, '
and she doesn't answer, that means she hates me"" story. I see you, see, I'm not the only one. The woman who wrote me that letter, she also feels trapped. If she stays with her husband,
she'll never trust him again, but if she leaves,
her children will suffer. Now, there's a cartoon
that I think is a perfect example of what's really going on
in these stories. The cartoon shows a prisoner
shaking the bars, desperately trying to get out. But on the right and the left, it's open. No bars. The prisoner isn't in jail. That's most of us. We feel completely trapped, stuck in our emotional jail cells. But we don't walk
around the bars to freedom because we know there's a catch. Freedom comes with responsibility. And if we take responsibility
for our role in the story, we might just have to change. And that's the other common theme
that I see in our stories: change. Those stories sound like this: a person says, ""I want to change."" But what they really mean is, ""I want another character
in the story to change."" Therapists describe this dilemma as: ""If the queen had balls,
she'd be the king."" I mean -- (Laughter) It makes no sense, right? Why wouldn't we want the protagonist, who's the hero of the story, to change? Well, it might be because change, even really positive change, involves a surprising amount of loss. Loss of the familiar. Even if the familiar is unpleasant
or utterly miserable, at least we know the characters
and setting and plot, right down to the recurring
dialogue in this story. ""You never do the laundry!"" ""I did it last time!"" ""Oh, yeah? When?"" There's something oddly comforting about knowing exactly
how the story is going to go every single time. To write a new chapter
is to venture into the unknown. It's to stare at a blank page. And as any writer will tell you, there's nothing more terrifying
than a blank page. But here's the thing. Once we edit our story, the next chapter
becomes much easier to write. We talk so much in our culture
about getting to know ourselves. But part of getting to know yourself
is to unknow yourself. To let go of the one version of the story
you've been telling yourself so that you can live your life, and not the story
that you've been telling yourself about your life. And that's how we walk around those bars. So I want to go back to the letter
from the woman, about the affair. She asked me what she should do. Now, I have this word
taped up in my office: ultracrepidarianism. The habit of giving advice or opinions
outside of one's knowledge or competence. It's a great word, right? You can use it in all different contexts, I'm sure you will be using it
after this TED Talk. I use it because it reminds me
that as a therapist, I can help people to sort out
what they want to do, but I can't make
their life choices for them. Only you can write your story, and all you need are some tools. So what I want to do is I want to edit this woman's letter
together, right here, as a way to show
how we can all revise our stories. And I want to start by asking you to think of a story
that you're telling yourself right now that might not be serving you well. It might be about a circumstance
you're experiencing, it might be about a person in your life, it might even be about yourself. And I want you to look
at the supporting characters. Who are the people who are helping you to uphold the wrong version of this story? For instance, if the woman
who wrote me that letter told her friends what happened, they would probably offer her
what's called ""idiot compassion."" Now, in idiot compassion,
we go along with the story, we say, ""You're right, that's so unfair,"" when a friend tells us that he didn't
get the promotion he wanted, even though we know this has happened
several times before because he doesn't really
put in the effort, and he probably
also steals office supplies. (Laughter) We say, ""Yeah, you're right, he's a jerk,"" when a friend tells us
that her boyfriend broke up with her, even though we know
that there are certain ways she tends to behave in relationships, like the incessant texting
or the going through his drawers, that tend to lead to this outcome. We see the problem, it's like, if a fight breaks out
in every bar you're going to, it might be you. (Laughter) In order to be good editors,
we need to offer wise compassion, not just to our friends, but to ourselves. This is what's called --
I think the technical term might be -- ""delivering compassionate truth bombs."" And these truth bombs are compassionate, because they help us to see
what we've left out of the story. The truth is, we don't know if this woman's husband
is having an affair, or why their sex life
changed two years ago, or what those late-night
phone calls are really about. And it might be
that because of her history, she's writing a singular
story of betrayal, but there's probably something else that she's not willing
to let me, in her letter, or maybe even herself, to see. It's like that guy
who's taking a Rorschach test. You all know what Rorschach tests are? A psychologist shows you some ink blots,
they look like that, and asks, ""What do you see?"" So the guy looks
at his ink blot and he says, ""Well, I definitely don't see blood."" And the examiner says, ""Alright, tell me what else
you definitely don't see."" In writing, this is called point of view. What is the narrator not willing to see? So, I want to read you one more letter. And it goes like this. ""Dear Therapist, I need help with my wife. Lately, everything I do irritates her, even small things, like the noise
I make when I chew. At breakfast, I noticed that she even tries
to secretly put extra milk in my granola so it won't be as crunchy."" (Laughter) ""I feel like she became critical of me
after my father died two years ago. I was very close with him, and her father left when she was young, so she couldn't relate
to what I was going through. There's a friend at work
whose father died a few months ago, and who understands my grief. I wish I could talk to my wife
like I talk to my friend, but I feel like she barely
tolerates me now. How can I get my wife back?"" OK. So, what you probably picked up on is that this is the same story
I read you earlier, just told from another
narrator's point of view. Her story was about
a husband who's cheating, his story is about a wife
who can't understand his grief. But what's remarkable,
is that for all of their differences, what both of these stories are about
is a longing for connection. And if we can get out
of the first-person narration and write the story
from another character's perspective, suddenly that other character
becomes much more sympathetic, and the plot opens up. That's the hardest step
in the editing process, but it's also where change begins. What would happen
if you looked at your story and wrote it from another
person's point of view? What would you see now
from this wider perspective? That's why, when I see people
who are depressed, I sometimes say, ""You are not the best person
to talk to you about you right now,"" because depression distorts our stories
in a very particular way. It narrows our perspectives. The same is true when we feel
lonely or hurt or rejected. We create all kinds of stories, distorted through a very narrow lens that we don't even know
we're looking through. And then, we've effectively become
our own fake-news broadcasters. I have a confession to make. I wrote the husband's version
of the letter I read you. You have no idea how much time I spent debating between granola
and pita chips, by the way. I wrote it based on all
of the alternative narratives that I've seen over the years, not just in my therapy practice,
but also in my column. When it's happened that two people involved
in the same situation have written to me,
unbeknownst to the other, and I have two versions of the same story sitting in my inbox. That really has happened. I don't know what the other version
of this woman's letter is, but I do know this: she has to write it. Because with a courageous edit, she'll write a much more nuanced version
of her letter that she wrote to me. Even if her husband
is having an affair of any kind -- and maybe he is -- she doesn't need to know
what the plot is yet. Because just by virtue of doing an edit, she'll have so many more possibilities
for what the plot can become. Now, sometimes it happens
that I see people who are really stuck, and they're really invested
in their stuckness. We call them help-rejecting complainers. I'm sure you know people like this. They're the people who,
when you try to offer them a suggestion, they reject it with, ""Yeah, no,
that will never work, because ..."" ""Yeah, no, that's impossible,
because I can't do that."" ""Yeah, I really want more friends,
but people are just so annoying."" (Laughter) What they're really rejecting is an edit to their story
of misery and stuckness. And so, with these people,
I usually take a different approach. And what I do is I say something else. I say to them, ""We're all going to die."" I bet you're really glad
I'm not your therapist right now. Because they look back at me the way you're looking back
at me right now, with this look of utter confusion. But then I explain that there's a story that gets written
about all of us, eventually. It's called an obituary. And I say that instead of being
authors of our own unhappiness, we get to shape these stories
while we're still alive. We get to be the hero
and not the victim in our stories, we get to choose what goes on the page
that lives in our minds and shapes our realities. I tell them that life is about deciding
which stories to listen to and which ones need an edit. And that it's worth the effort
to go through a revision because there's nothing more important
to the quality of our lives than the stories
we tell ourselves about them. I say that when it comes
to the stories of our lives, we should be aiming for our own
personal Pulitzer Prize. Now, most of us aren't
help-rejecting complainers, or at least we don't believe we are. But it's a role
that is so easy to slip into when we feel anxious
or angry or vulnerable. So the next time
you're struggling with something, remember, we're all going to die. (Laughter) And then pull out your editing tools and ask yourself: what do I want my story to be? And then, go write your masterpiece. Thank you. (Applause)",2019-11-22T21:54:38Z
What I learned about freedom after escaping North Korea,Yeonmi Park,2764584,116224,5337,"""North Korea is unimaginable,"" says human rights activist Yeonmi Park, who escaped the country at the age of 13. Sharing the ...","I was born in 1993
in the northern part of North Korea, in a town called Hyesan, which is on the border with China. I had loving parents and one older sister. Before I was even 10 years old, my father was sent to a labor camp for engaging in illegal trading. Now, by ""illegal trading"" -- he was selling clogs, sugar,
rice and later copper to feed us. In 2007, my sister and I
decided to escape. She was 16 years old, and I was 13 years old. I need you to understand
what the word ""escape"" means in the context of North Korea. We were all starving, and hunger means death in North Korea. So it was the only option for us. I didn't even understand
the concept of escape, but I could see the lights
from China at night, and I wondered if I go where the light is, I might be able to find a bowl of rice. It's not like we had a grand plan or maps. We did not know anything
about what was going to happen. Imagine your apartment
building caught fire. I mean, what would you do? Would you stay there to be burned, or would you jump off out of the window and see what happens? That's what we did. We jumped out of the house instead of the fire. North Korea is unimaginable. It's very hard for me when people ask me
what it feels like to live there. To be honest, I tell you: you can't even imagine it. The words in any language can't describe, because it's a totally different planet, as you cannot imagine
your life on Mars right now. For example, the word ""love""
has only one meaning: love for the Dear Leader. There's no concept
of romantic love in North Korea. And if you don't know the words, that means you don't
understand the concept, and therefore, you don't even realize
that concept is even a possibility. Let me give you another example. Growing up in North Korea, we truly believed that our Dear Leader
is an almighty god who can even read my thoughts. I was even afraid to think in North Korea. We are told that he's starving for us, and he's working tirelessly for us, and my heart just broke for him. When I escaped to South Korea, people told me that
he was actually a dictator, he had cars, many, many resorts, and he had an ultraluxurious life. And then I remember
looking at a picture of him, realizing for the first time that he is the largest guy in the picture. (Laughter) And it hit me. Finally, I realized he wasn't starving. But I was never able to see that before, until someone told me that he was fat. (Laughter) Really, someone had to teach me
that he was fat. If you have never practiced
critical thinking, then you simply see
what you're told to see. The biggest question also people ask me is: ""Why is there no revolution
inside North Korea? Are we dumb? Why is there no revolution
for 70 years of this oppression?"" And I say: If you don't know you're a slave, if you don't know
you're isolated or oppressed, how do you fight to be free? I mean, if you know you're isolated, that means you are not isolated. Not knowing is the true
definition of isolation, and that's why I never knew I was isolated when I was in North Korea. I literally thought I was
in the center of the universe. So here is my idea worth spreading: a lot of people think humans inherently know
what is right and wrong, the difference between
justice and injustice, what we deserve and we don't deserve. I tell them: BS. (Laughter) (Applause) Everything, everything must be taught, including compassion. If I see someone dying
on the street right now, I will do anything to save that person. But when I was in North Korea, I saw people dying
and dead on the streets. I felt nothing. Not because I'm a psychopath, but because I never learned
the concept of compassion. Only, I felt compassion,
empathy and sympathy in my heart after I learned the word
""compassion"" and the concept, and I feel them now. Now I live in the United States
as a free person. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) And recently, the leader of the free country,
our President Trump, met with my former god. And he decided human rights
is not important enough to include in his agendas, and he did not talk about it. And it scares me. We live in a world right now where a dictator can be praised
for executing his uncle, for killing his half brother, killing thousands of North Koreans. And that was worthy of praise. And also it made me think: perhaps we all need to be taught
something new about freedom now. Freedom is fragile. I don't want to alarm you, but it is. It only took three generations to make North Korea into
George Orwell's ""1984."" It took only three generations. If we don't fight for human rights for the people who are oppressed
right now who don't have a voice, as free people here, who will fight for us
when we are not free? Machines? Animals? I don't know. I think it's wonderful
that we care about climate change, animal rights, gender equality, all of these things. The fact that we care
about animals' rights, that means that's
how beautiful our heart is, that we care about someone
who cannot speak for themselves. And North Koreans right now
cannot speak for themselves. They don't have internet
in the 21st century. We don't have electricity, and it is the darkest place
on earth right now. Now I want to say something
to my fellow North Koreans who are living in that darkness. They might not believe this, but I want to tell them
that an alternative life is possible. Be free. From my experience, literally anything is possible. I was bought, I was sold as a slave. But now I'm here, and that is why I believe in miracles. The one thing that I learned from history is that nothing is forever in this world. And that is why we have
every reason to be hopeful. Thank you. (Applause)",2019-09-26T20:01:03Z
"Mentalism, mind reading and the art of getting inside your head",Derren Brown,1945490,37851,2428,"""Magic is a great analogy for how we edit reality and form a story -- and then mistake that story for the truth,"" says psychological ...","We are all trapped inside our own heads, and our beliefs and our understandings
about the world are limited by that perspective, which means we tell ourselves stories. Right? So here we are
in this infinite data source. There's an infinite number of things
that we could think about, but we edit and delete. We choose what to think about,
what to pay attention to. We make up a story ... to make sense of what's going on, and we all get it wrong. Because we're all trying to navigate
with our own skewed compasses, and we all have our own baggage, but the stories themselves
are utterly convincing. And we all do this, and a lot of the stories
that we live by aren't even our own. The first ones we inherit
at a young age from our parents, who of course have
their own skewed beliefs, their own frustrations,
their own unlived lives. And for better or worse,
we take all that onboard, and then we go out into the world thinking maybe we have to
be successful to be loved; or that we always have to put
other people's needs first; or that we have some big terrible secret
we couldn't possible tell people. And it's just fiction, it's just stories, and we'd worry a lot less
about what other people think of us if we realized how seldom they do. (Laughter) So I feel that magic is a great analogy
for how we edit reality and form a story and then mistake that story for the truth, and I've had a 20-year career in the UK staging big psychological
experiments on TV, and now that's on Netflix. I also have a stage show. I've got my first Broadway show actually
coming up, called ""Secret."" Just throwing that out there. No pressure. (Laughter) That should be this year. And I try to do something new
with mentalism, mentalism, which is the dubious art
of getting inside your head. So there was a heyday
for this kind of stage mind-reading, which was the 1930s. That's why I'm dressed like this, in my most un-TED-like garb. And there was an act,
an act known as the Oracle Act. And in the Oracle Act,
members of the audience, as I know you have done, would write down secret questions, the sort of questions
you might ask a psychic, seal that question into an envelope, and on the outside of the envelope
they would write their initials and then roughly
where they sat in the audience. And then the Oracle, the mind reader,
would take an envelope one at a time, he wouldn't open it, but he would attempt to divine
what question was sealed inside. And if he got that right,
he would try and answer the question for the person too. And the act spread like wildfire. It's a testament, I think,
to the seductive appeal of some powerful figure
offering you easy, simple answers to life's complex and subtle questions and anxieties. So thank you all of you
that wrote questions. I haven't seen these.
I know somebody's guarding them. Thank you so much. I will take those now.
Thank you all of you that did this. I should say, probably,
a couple of things before I start. In absolute honesty, first of all I can't see
through these envelopes. They are sealed.
They are thick black envelopes. You'll know if you wrote one.
I can't see through them. Secondly, importantly,
I don't know any of you and nobody is playing along. That's not what this is. Thirdly ... I don't believe for a second that I have
any special psychological gifts, let alone any psychic ones. So let's begin. Nope. (Laughter) OK, this -- Oh, nice. OK, this one's interesting.
There's a couple here. I will start with maybe this one. This one's interesting,
because the writing undulates. There's a sort of an up and down thing, which normally -- not always --
normally means that the person doesn't know
the answer to the question themselves, so it's normally a question
about the future, right? That sort of suggests uncertainty. So I would say it's a lady, age-wise it's a little difficult to tell
from this minimal handwriting, but I would expect maybe 30s,
maybe 40s, but let's find out. It says -- and a question
about the future -- it says, ""JN, center."" So it's going to be somebody
in this big central section here. If you think this is you,
if you wrote one, could you make a fuss? It's a bit difficult for me
to see in the center. Hi, give us a wave. So J ... Jane? Jessica? Jessica: Yes. Derren Brown: Which one?
Jessica: Jessica. DB: Thank you. Just a guess.
Little murmur of approval, thank you? (Laughter) I'll take it. Alright, so Jessica,
I won't ask your age, but is it a question
essentially about the future? Jessica: Mhm?
DB: Yes? Jessica: Yes.
DB: Yes. OK. Alright. So what did we ask?
What did Jessica ask about the future? So am I OK with late-30s, early-40s? Jessica: I'll take it. I'm taking it. (Laughter) DB: OK, so it's important, because we ask different questions
depending how old we are. Just say, ""I'll take it"" again. Jessica: I'll take it. DB: Virginia? You're from Virginia?
Jessica: Yes, I am. DB: Yeah. So -- (Laughter) I think this is a lady, I think this is a lady
who wants to leave Virginia. I think you're looking at plans, it's whether or not things
are going to come together to get out. Just show me your hands. Other sides so I can see fingernails? OK, I think you have a farm and it's whether or not you're going
to sell your farm and get out of Virginia? Is this right? Jessica: Absolutely, that's the question. DB: Alright. Great. Thank you.
It's a great question! What was the actual question?
What did you put? Jessica: ""Will I sell
the farm in Virginia?"" DB: Will you sell the farm? Alright, so look, it's a great question
if you are pretending to be psychic, because it's about the future, which means I can give you
a yes or no on this. It means nothing.
You have no way of verifying it. And a dangerous thing to do -- and if I say yes or no,
it'll just stick in the back of your mind, and it can't not start to affect
decisions you make. So a dangerous thing to do. However -- (Laughter) Yes, I think you will sell the farm, because I think you're the sort of person that in the nicest way
will get what you want. I think when there are things you want,
you tend to focus on them at the expense of other things that you know you probably
should be focusing on more, would you agree? Educated, you spent a few years in -- Say yes again, the word ""yes"" quickly?
Jessica: Yes. DB: No?
Jessica: No. DB: California? Berkeley?
A bit of a guess, but ... Jessica: I went to Berkeley, yes.
Stop doing this! DB: So it's a yes. Oh, and you've been
to India recently as well. There's just a tiny, tiny little thing
going on there. Yes? No? Jessica: Yes, I just got back from India. DB: It's a yes from me, I just don't want
to say it like it's written in the stars because it isn't, and you need
to take responsibility for it. DB: Have a seat.
Thank you. Let's do another one. (Applause) AH, also in the center? AH. This will be a man, a little older,
maybe late 40s, I would say from this. AH, center, stand up for me
if you think this is you. AH. Hi, let's get
a microphone to this guy. Quick as we can,
on camera would be amazing. Oh, look at that! Freeze.
Don't move. Don't move. Keep absolutely still. Are you standing? Where are you? Man: I am standing. I'm not that short. DB: OK. Alright, now you changed that. There was just something
you did as you got up. Yes or no, have you
put something on here -- you're not doing it now,
but you did it as you stood up -- to do with your left or your left leg
or your left foot, yes or no? Man: Yes. DB: Alright. He was giving us
a nice clear signal as he stood up. Put your weight on your
left-hand side and say ""yes."" Man: Yes. DB: Take your hand out of that pocket,
put your weight on the other side, change hands with the mic
and say ""yes"" again. Man: Yes. DB: You have a dislocation in the big toe on your left-hand side? Man: Yes. DB: Thank you so much. Great.
Good one! Take a seat. Take a seat. Can I get the microphone?
I'm going to change microphone for this. Can I grab a mic up? Thank you. Thank you so much.
That would be great there. I'm going to change mic because, hopefully you can now still hear me? So I'm going to blindfold myself. And I'm doing this now so I don't
have the clues as you stand up. I can't see where you put your hands. I can't see how you respond
to what I'm saying. I can't see what the people
next to you are doing either. If they know the answers to the question,
that's always very helpful. I won't have those advantages, but strangely, this frees me up, and I want this to free you up as well, so if you didn't write a question but you wish that you had done, you can still take part. The point of writing the question
is only that it just kind of gets a nice, clear, succinct
wording in your head. So if you can just find
a question in your head, make it clear and succinct,
just send it to me, and I'll try and do this now
without anything written down. So just start to form questions
but send me your name as well. ""My name is,"" whatever that last guy was, and ""what's strange about my feet,""
or whatever the question was. So name and question. There is somebody already,
I'm guessing you're quite near the front, because your name is quite clear. Feels like you're
in the center at the front. OK, let me just ... Allan? Feels like there's an Allan. And you're going to be quite near
the front, vaguely central, I think. Feels like it's coming from right there. There's like a man, maybe early 60s,
something like that. Allan: Yes. DB: You've got a mic? Great, thank you. Allan, just say ""stop"" when I get to you
so that I know where you are, where to face. Allan: Stop. DB: You a Capricorn?
Allan: Yes. DB: So Allan has something in his head. Now, did you hear it,
hear the reserve in his voice? It's going to be something really tricky. I think with you ...
Just say ""yes"" again for me? Allan: Yes. DB: It's going to be either -- no it's not. It's access, it's a password
or access to something. Have you got something, just yes or no,
with a password in your head? Allan: Yes. DB: A computer password,
that sort of thing? Allan: Yes. DB: Excellent! (Laughter) In that case, I'm going
to finish on this one. Let me --- If I get this right, they're all going to know what it is,
and millions of people potentially. You will change it, won't you? Allan: Of course. (Laughter) DB: Just say ""of course"" again?
Allan: Of course. DB: Alright. If it's a word --
I imagine it's a word, right -- just see the password
written in front of you, big clear block capital letters, and as you look at it, think for me
of a letter somewhere in the middle, don't say it out loud, just get a letter in your head
that's in the middle. Have you got one?
Allan: Yeah. DB: OK, stick with that for me. Ah, you changed it, OK. You changed your mind there. I think you settled on a -- I think that's a ""B"", yes? Allan: No. I didn't. DB: Then it's an ""I""?
Allan: Correct. DB: But you had a B.
Allan: Yes. DB: Yeah, he changed his mind.
He changed his mind. (Laughter) So see it written there. Just keep saying it
to yourself in your head. Oh, you play drums, don't you. Allan: I do. DB: Just get that out of your head,
get that out of your head, just focus on this one thing for me. (Laughter) My job is to sell you a story, right? I try and do this to all of you,
to get you to pay attention to one thing that I want you
to find important, ignore other things
that I want you to ignore, and then join up those narrative dots to tell yourself a certain story
about what I'm doing, and this only works because
we are story-forming creatures, which means we do this every day. We go out into this complex
and subtle world full of a complex and subtle people
like you and me, Allan, and we reduce them
to these neat characters that fit whatever story
we're telling ourselves, and we say, ""She's insecure,""
""He's arrogant,"" ""They can't be trusted."" And these are just stories like the story
that I can somehow read your mind. You're thinking of selling your company
as well, aren't you, at the moment. Allan: Correct. DB: Which is something to do with skin? Allan: Yes. DB: Skin care or something like this. Allan: Uh, yes. DB: And I think the reason
why I love doing this is that it reminds me at least
to try and be more alive and alert to the complexity
and the subtlety of what's real, that there's always other stuff
going on that we don't know about, and it means we can get less stuck,
we can be kinder to people because we can recognize
there's always fear behind their stress, so we don't need
to meet it as defensively, and we can start to see the stories
for what they are and recognize that life
isn't all about us. Oh! Your password, where are you?
Where are you? Where is he? Allan: Right here. DB: Stand up for me.
Your password is ""ariboy."" A-r-i-b-o-y? Is that right?
Allan: That's correct. DB: Then thank you so much.
Thank you very much indeed. Thank you. (Applause)",2019-08-26T13:42:17Z
My identity is a superpower -- not an obstacle,America Ferrera,944982,21746,959,"Hollywood needs to stop resisting what the world actually looks like, says actor, director and activist America Ferrera. Tracing the ...","On the red tiles in my family's den I would dance and sing
to the made-for-TV movie ""Gypsy,"" starring Bette Midler. (Singing) ""I had a dream. A wonderful dream, papa."" I would sing it with the urgency
and the burning desire of a nine-year-old who did, in fact, have a dream. My dream was to be an actress. And it's true that I never saw
anyone who looked like me in television or in films, and sure, my family and friends
and teachers all constantly warned me that people like me
didn't make it in Hollywood. But I was an American. I had been taught to believe
that anyone could achieve anything, regardless of the color of their skin, the fact that my parents
immigrated from Honduras, the fact that I had no money. I didn't need my dream to be easy, I just needed it to be possible. And when I was 15, I got my first professional audition. It was a commercial
for cable subscriptions or bail bonds, I don't really remember. (Laughter) What I do remember
is that the casting director asked me, ""Could you do that again,
but just this time, sound more Latina."" ""Um, OK. So you want me
to do it in Spanish?"" I asked. ""No, no, do it in English,
just sound Latina."" ""Well, I am a Latina,
so isn't this what a Latina sounds like?"" There was a long and awkward silence, and then finally, ""OK, sweetie, never mind,
thank you for coming in, bye!"" It took me most of the car ride home
to realize that by ""sound more Latina"" she was asking me
to speak in broken English. And I couldn't figure out why the fact that I was an actual,
real-life, authentic Latina didn't really seem to matter. Anyway, I didn't get the job. I didn't get a lot of the jobs
people were willing to see me for: the gang-banger's girlfriend, the sassy shoplifter, pregnant chola number two. (Laughter) These were the kinds of roles
that existed for someone like me. Someone they looked at
and saw as too brown, too fat, too poor, too unsophisticated. These roles were stereotypes and couldn't have been further
from my own reality or from the roles I dreamt of playing. I wanted to play people
who were complex and multidimensional, people who existed in the center
of their own lives. Not cardboard cutouts that stood
in the background of someone else's. But when I dared to say that
to my manager -- that's the person I pay
to help me find opportunity -- his response was, ""Someone has to tell that girl
she has unrealistic expectations."" And he wasn't wrong. I mean, I fired him, but he wasn't wrong. (Laughter) (Applause) Because whenever I did try to get a role
that wasn't a poorly written stereotype, I would hear, ""We're not looking
to cast this role diversely."" Or, ""We love her,
but she's too specifically ethnic."" Or, ""Unfortunately, we already have
one Latino in this movie."" I kept receiving the same message
again and again and again. That my identity was an obstacle
I had to overcome. And so I thought, ""Come at me, obstacle. I'm an American. My name is America. I trained my whole life for this,
I'll just follow the playbook, I'll work harder."" And so I did, I worked my hardest to overcome all the things
that people said were wrong with me. I stayed out of the sun
so that my skin wouldn't get too brown, I straightened my curls into submission. I constantly tried to lose weight, I bought fancier
and more expensive clothes. All so that when people looked at me, they wouldn't see a too fat,
too brown, too poor Latina. They would see what I was capable of. And maybe they would give me a chance. And in an ironic twist of fate, when I finally did get a role
that would make all my dreams come true, it was a role that required me
to be exactly who I was. Ana in ""Real Women Have Curves"" was a brown, poor, fat Latina. I had never seen anyone
like her, anyone like me, existing in the center
of her own life story. I traveled throughout the US and to multiple countries with this film where people, regardless of their age,
ethnicity, body type, saw themselves in Ana. A 17-year-old chubby Mexican American girl struggling against cultural norms
to fulfill her unlikely dream. In spite of what
I had been told my whole life, I saw firsthand that people actually did
want to see stories about people like me. And that my unrealistic expectations to see myself authentically
represented in the culture were other people’s expectations, too. ""Real Women Have Curves"" was a critical, cultural
and financial success. ""Great,"" I thought, ""We did it! We proved our stories have value. Things are going to change now."" But I watched as very little happened. There was no watershed. No one in the industry
was rushing to tell more stories about the audience that was hungry
and willing to pay to see them. Four years later,
when I got to play Ugly Betty, I saw the same phenomenon play out. ""Ugly Betty"" premiered in the US
to 16 million viewers and was nominated
for 11 Emmys in its first year. (Applause) But in spite of ""Ugly Betty's"" success, there would not be another television show led by a Latina actress on American television for eight years. It's been 12 years since I became the first and only Latina to ever win an Emmy in a lead category. That is not a point of pride. That is a point of deep frustration. Not because awards prove our worth, but because who we see
thriving in the world teaches us how to see ourselves, how to think about our own value, how to dream about our futures. And anytime I begin to doubt that, I remember that there was a little girl,
living in the Swat Valley of Pakistan. And somehow, she got
her hands on some DVDs of an American television show in which she saw her own dream
of becoming a writer reflected. In her autobiography, Malala wrote, ""I had become interested in journalism after seeing how my own words
could make a difference and also from watching
the ""Ugly Betty"" DVDs about life at an American magazine."" (Applause) For 17 years of my career, I have witnessed the power our voices have when they can access
presence in the culture. I've seen it. I've lived it, we've all seen it. In entertainment, in politics, in business, in social change. We cannot deny it --
presence creates possibility. But for the last 17 years, I've also heard the same excuses for why some of us can access
presence in the culture and some of us can't. Our stories don't have an audience, our experiences won't resonate
in the mainstream, our voices are too big a financial risk. Just a few years ago, my agent called to explain to me why
I wasn't getting a role in a movie. He said, ""They loved you and they really, really do want
to cast diversely, but the movie isn't financeable
until they cast the white role first."" He delivered the message
with a broken heart and with a tone that communicated,
""I understand how messed up this is."" But nonetheless, just like
hundreds of times before, I felt the tears roll down my face. And the pang of rejection rise up in me and then the voice of shame scolding me, ""You are a grown woman,
stop crying over a job."" I went through this process for years
of accepting the failure as my own and then feeling deep shame
that I couldn't overcome the obstacles. But this time, I heard a new voice. A voice that said, ""I'm tired. I've had enough."" A voice that understood my tears and my pain
were not about losing a job. They were about what
was actually being said about me. What had been said about me my whole life by executives and producers and directors and writers
and agents and managers and teachers and friends and family. That I was a person of less value. I thought sunscreen
and straightening irons would bring about change
in this deeply entrenched value system. But what I realized in that moment was that I was never actually asking
the system to change. I was asking it to let me in,
and those aren't the same thing. I couldn't change
what a system believed about me, while I believed what
the system believed about me. And I did. I, like everyone around me, believed that it wasn't possible
for me to exist in my dream as I was. And I went about
trying to make myself invisible. What this revealed to me
was that it is possible to be the person
who genuinely wants to see change while also being the person whose actions
keep things the way they are. And what it's led me to believe
is that change isn't going to come by identifying the good guys
and the bad guys. That conversation
lets us all off the hook. Because most of us
are neither one of those. Change will come when each of us has the courage to question our own fundamental
values and beliefs. And then see to it that our actions
lead to our best intentions. I am just one of millions of people who have been told
that in order to fulfill my dreams, in order to contribute
my talents to the world I have to resist the truth of who I am. I for one, am ready to stop resisting and to start existing
as my full and authentic self. If I could go back and say anything to that nine-year-old,
dancing in the den, dreaming her dreams, I would say, my identity is not my obstacle. My identity is my superpower. Because the truth is, I am what the world looks like. You are what the world looks like. Collectively, we are
what the world actually looks like. And in order for our systems
to reflect that, they don't have to create a new reality. They just have to stop
resisting the one we already live in. Thank you. (Applause)",2019-06-21T13:29:06Z
How to build your confidence -- and spark it in others,Brittany Packnett Cunningham,2005009,47025,596,"""Confidence is the necessary spark before everything that follows,"" says educator and activist Brittany Packnett Cunningham.","So when I was a little girl, a book sat on the coffee table
in our living room, just steps from our front door. And the living room is a first impression. Ours had white carpet and a curio of my mother's
most treasured collectibles. That room represented the sacrifices
of generations gone by who, by poverty or by policy, couldn't afford a curio of collectibles let alone a middle class house
to put them in. That room had to stay perfect. But I would risk messing up
that perfect room every day just to see that book. On the cover sat a woman
named Septima Clark. She sat in perfect profile
with her face raised to the sky. She had perfect salt-and-pepper cornrows platted down the sides of her head, and pride and wisdom
just emanated from her dark skin. Septima Clark was an activist
and an educator, a woman after whom I'd eventually
model my own career. But more than all the words
she ever spoke, that single portrait of Septima Clark, it defined confidence for me before I ever even knew the word. It may sound simple, but confidence is something
that we underestimate the importance of. We treat it like a nice-to-have
instead of a must-have. We place value on knowledge and resources above what we deem to be
the soft skill of confidence. But by most measures,
we have more knowledge and more resources now
than at any other point in history, and still injustice abounds
and challenges persist. If knowledge and resources
were all that we needed, we wouldn't still be here. And I believe that confidence
is one of the main things missing from the equation. I'm completely obsessed with confidence. It's been the most important
journey of my life, a journey that,
to be honest, I'm still on. Confidence is the necessary spark
before everything that follows. Confidence is the difference
between being inspired and actually getting started, between trying and doing until it's done. Confidence helps us keep going
even when we failed. The name of the book on that coffee table
was ""I Dream A World,"" and today I dream a world
where revolutionary confidence helps bring about our
most ambitious dreams into reality. That's exactly the kind of world
that I wanted to create in my classroom when I was a teacher, like a Willy Wonka world
of pure imagination, but make it scholarly. All of my students were black or brown. All of them were growing up
in a low-income circumstance. Some of them were immigrants,
some of them were disabled, but all of them were the very last people this world invites to be confident. That's why it was so important
that my classroom be a place where my students could build
the muscle of confidence, where they could learn to face each day
with the confidence you need to redesign the world
in the image of your own dreams. After all, what are academic skills
without the confidence to use those skills to go out and change the world. Now is when I should tell you about
two of my students, Jamal and Regina. Now, I've changed their names,
but their stories remain the same. Jamal was brilliant, but unfocused. He would squirm in his chair
during independent work, and he would never stay still
for more than three or four minutes. Students like Jamal
can perplex brand new teachers because they're not quite sure
how to support young people like him. I took a direct approach. I negotiated with Jamal. If he could give me focused work, then he could do it
from anywhere in the classroom, from our classroom rug,
from behind my desk, from inside his classroom locker,
which turned out to be his favorite place. Jamal's least favorite
subject was writing, and he never wanted to read
what he had written out loud in class, but we were still making progress. One day, I decided to host
a mock 2008 presidential election in my classroom. My third graders had to research
and write a stump speech for their chosen candidate: Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton
or John McCain. The heavy favorites were obvious, but one student chose John McCain. It was Jamal. Jamal finally decided to read something
that he had written out loud in class, and sure enough, Jamal stunned
all of us with his brilliance. Just like Jamal's dad,
John McCain was a veteran, and just like Jamal's dad protected him, Jamal believed that John McCain
would protect the entire country. And he wasn't my candidate of choice,
but it didn't matter, because the entire class
erupted into applause, a standing ovation
for our brave friend Jamal who finally showed up
as his most confident self for the first time that year. And then there was Regina. Regina was equally
as brilliant, but active. She'd inevitably finish her work early, and then she'd get on about the business
of distracting other students. (Laughter) Walking, talking, passing those notes
that teachers hate but kids love. You look like you passed a lot of them. (Laughter) Despite my high ideals for our classroom, I would too often default
to my baser instincts, and I would choose
compliance over confidence. Regina was a glitch in my intended system. A good teacher can correct misbehavior but still remain a student's champion. But on one day in particular, I just plain old chose control. I snapped, and my approach
didn't communicate to Regina that she was being a distraction. My approach communicated to Regina
that she herself was a distraction. I watched the light go out from her eyes, and that light sparked joy
in our classroom. I had just extinguished it. The entire class became irritable, and we didn't recover
for the rest of the day. I think about the day often, and I have literally prayed
that I did not do irreparable harm, because as a woman who used to be
a little girl just like Regina, I know that I could have started
the process of killing her confidence forever. A lack of confidence
pulls us down from the bottom and weighs us down from the top, crushing us between a flurry
of can'ts, won'ts and impossibles. Without confidence, we get stuck, and when we get stuck,
we can't even get started. Instead of getting mired
in what can get in our way, confidence invites us
to perform with certainty. We all operate a little differently
when we're sure we can win versus if we just hope we will. Now, this can be a helpful check. If you don't have enough confidence, it could be because you need
to readjust your goal. If you have too much confidence, it could be because
you're not rooted in something real. Not everyone lacks confidence. We make it easier in this society
for some people to gain confidence because they fit our preferred
archetype of leadership. We reward confidence in some people and we punish confidence in others, and all the while far too many people are walking around
every single day without it. For some of us, confidence is a revolutionary choice, and it would be our greatest shame to see our best ideas go unrealized and our brightest dreams go unreached all because we lacked
the engine of confidence. That's not a risk I'm willing to take. So how do we crack the code on confidence? In my estimation,
it takes at least three things: permission, community and curiosity. Permission births confidence, community nurtures it and curiosity affirms it. In education, we've got a saying, that you can't be what you can't see. When I was a little girl,
I couldn't show confidence until someone showed me. My family used to do everything together, including the mundane things,
like buying a new car, and every time we did this, I'd watch my parents
put on the exact same performance. We'd enter the dealership, and my dad would sit while my mom shopped. When my mom found a car that she liked, they'd go in and meet with the dealer, and inevitably, every time
the dealer would turn his attention and his body to my dad, assuming that he
controlled the purse strings and therefore this negotiation. ""Rev. Packnett,"" they'd say,
""how do we get you into this car today?"" My dad would inevitably
respond the same way. He'd slowly and silently
gesture toward my mother and then put his hands
right back in his lap. It might have been the complete shock of negotiating finances
with a black woman in the '80s, but whatever it was, I'd watch my mother
work these car dealers over until they were basically
giving the car away for free. (Laughter) She would never crack a smile. She would never be afraid to walk away. I know my mom just thought
she was getting a good deal on a minivan, but what she was actually doing was giving me permission
to defy expectations and to show up confidently in my skill
no matter who doubts me. Confidence needs permission to exist and community is the safest place
to try confidence on. I traveled to Kenya this year
to learn about women's empowerment among Maasai women. There I met a group of young women called Team Lioness, among Kenya's first all-female
community ranger groups. These eight brave young women
were making history in just their teenage years, and I asked Purity, the most verbose
young ranger among them, ""Do you ever get scared?"" I swear to you, I want to tattoo
her response all over my entire body. She said, ""Of course I do, but I call on my sisters. They remind me that we
will be better than these men and that we will not fail."" Purity's confidence to chase down
lions and catch poachers, it didn't come from her athletic ability
or even just her faith. Her confidence was
propped up by sisterhood, by community. What she was basically saying
was that if I am ever in doubt, I need you to be there to restore my hope and to rebuild my certainty. In community, I can find my confidence and your curiosity can affirm it. Early in my career,
I led a large-scale event that did not go exactly as planned. I'm lying to you. It was terrible. And when I debriefed the event
with my manager, I just knew that she
was going to run down the list of every mistake I had ever made, probably from birth. But instead, she opened with a question: What was your intention? I was surprised but relieved. She knew that I was already
beating myself up, and that question invited me
to learn from my own mistakes instead of damage
my already fragile confidence. Curiosity invites people
to be in charge of their own learning. That exchange, it helped me
approach my next project with the expectation of success. Permission, community, curiosity: all of these are the things that we
will need to breed the confidence that we'll absolutely need
to solve our greatest challenges and to build the world we dream, a world where inequity is ended
and where justice is real, a world where we can be free
on the outside and free on the inside because we know that none of us are free
until all of us are free. A world that isn't
intimidated by confidence when it shows up as a woman or in black skin or in anything other than
our preferred archetypes of leadership. A world that knows
that that kind of confidence is exactly the key we need
to unlock the future that we want. I have enough confidence
to believe that that world will indeed come to pass, and that we are the ones to make it so. Thank you so much. (Applause)",2019-06-17T12:45:38Z
The difference between healthy and unhealthy love,Katie Hood,5744462,158813,2776,"In a talk about understanding and practicing the art of healthy relationships, Katie Hood reveals the five signs you might be in an ...","So when you think about a child,
a close friend, or a romantic partner, the word ""love"" probably comes to mind, and instantly other emotions rush in: joy and hope, excitement, trust and security, and yes, sometimes
sadness and disappointment. There might not be
a word in the dictionary that more of us
are connected to than love. Yet, given its central
importance in our lives, isn't it interesting that we're never
explicitly taught how to love? We build friendships, navigate early romantic relationships, get married and bring babies
home from the hospital with the expectation
that we'll figure it out. But the truth is, we often
harm and disrespect the ones we love. It can be subtle things like guilting a friend
into spending time with you or sneaking a peak at your partner's texts or shaming a child
for their lack of effort at school. 100 percent of us
will be on the receiving end of unhealthy relationship behaviors and 100 percent of us
will do unhealthy things. It's part of being human. In its worst form,
the harm we inflict on loved ones shows up as abuse and violence, and relationship abuse is something that one in three women
and one in four men will experience in their lifetime. Now, if you're like most people,
when you hear those stats, you'll go, ""Oh, no, no, no,
that would never happen to me."" It's instinctual to move away
from the words ""abuse"" and ""violence,"" to think that they happen
to someone else somewhere else. But the truth is, unhealthy relationships
and abuse are all around us. We just call them different things
and ignore the connection. Abuse sneaks up on us
disguised in unhealthy love. I work for an organization called One Love started by a family whose daughter
Yeardley was killed by her ex-boyfriend. This was a tragedy no one saw coming, but when they looked back,
they realized the warning signs were there just no one understood
what they were seeing. Called crazy or drama
or too much drinking, his actions weren't understood
to be what they really were, which was clear signs of danger. Her family realized that if anyone
had been educated about these signs, her death could have been prevented. So today we're on a mission to make sure that others have the information
that Yeardley and her friends didn't. We have three main goals: give all of us a language
for talking about a subject that's quite awkward
and uncomfortable to discuss; empower a whole front line,
namely friends, to help; and, in the process, improve
all of our ability to love better. To do this, it's always important
to start by illuminating the unhealthy signs
that we frequently miss, and our work really focuses
on creating content to start conversations with young people. As you'd expect, most of our content
is pretty serious, given the subject at hand, but today I'm going to use
one of our more light-hearted yet still thought-provoking pieces, ""The Couplets,"" to illuminate five markers
of unhealthy love. The first is intensity. (Video) Blue: I haven't seen you
in a couple days. I've missed you. Orange: I've missed you too. (#thatslove) Blue: I haven't seen you in five minutes.
It feels like a lifetime. What have you been doing
without me for five whole minutes? Orange: It's been three minutes.
(#thatsnotlove) Katie Hood: Anybody recognize that?
I don't know. I do. Abusive relationships
don't start out abusive. They start out exciting and exhilarating. There's an intensity
of affection and emotion, a rush. It feels really good. You feel so lucky,
like you've hit the jackpot. But in unhealthy love,
these feelings shift over time from exciting to overwhelming
and maybe a little bit suffocating. You feel it in your gut. Maybe it's when your
new boyfriend or girlfriend says ""I love you""
faster than you were ready for or starts showing up everywhere,
texting and calling a lot. Maybe they're impatient
when you're slow to respond, even though they know
you had other things going on that day. It's important to remember that it's not
how a relationship starts that matters, it's how it evolves. It's important in the early days
of a new relationship to pay attention to how you're feeling. Are you comfortable
with the pace of intimacy? Do you feel like you have space
and room to breathe? It's also really important
to start practicing using your voice to talk about your own needs. Are your requests respected? A second marker is isolation. (Video) Orange 2: Want to hang out? Orange 1: Me and my boyfriend
always have Monday Funday. Orange 2: Want to hang out? Orange 1: Me and my boyfriend
always have Monday Funday. Orange 2: Tomorrow?
Orange 1: It's our Tuesday Snooze Day. Orange 2: Wednesday?
Orange 1: No Friends Day. KH: If you ask me, isolation
is one of the most frequently missed and misunderstood signs of unhealthy love. Why? Because every new relationship
starts out with this intense desire to spend time together, it's easy to miss when something shifts. Isolation creeps in
when your new boyfriend or girlfriend starts pulling you away
from your friends and family, your support system, and tethering you more tightly to them. They might say things like, ""Why do you hang out with them?
They're such losers"" about your best friends, or, ""They want us to break up.
They're totally against us"" about your family. Isolation is about sowing seeds of doubt about everyone from
your prerelationship life. Healthy love includes independence, two people who love spending time together but who stay connected to the people
and activities they cared about before. While at first you might spend
every waking minute together, over time maintaining independence is key. You do this by making plans with friends
and sticking to them and encouraging your partner
to do the same. A third marker of unhealthy love
is extreme jealousy. (Video) Blue 2:
What are you so happy about? Blue 1: She just started
following me on Instagram! Blue 2: What are you so nervous about? Blue 1: She, she just started
following me, like, everywhere. (#thatsnotlove) KH: As the honeymoon period
begins to fade, extreme jealousy can creep in. Your partner might become more demanding, needing to know where you are
and who you're with all the time, or they might start following you
everywhere, online and off. Extreme jealousy also brings with it
possessiveness and mistrust, frequent accusations
of flirting with other people or cheating, and refusal to listen to you
when you tell them they have nothing to worry about
and that you only love them. Jealousy is a part
of any human relationship, but extreme jealousy is different. There's a threatening, desperate
and angry edge to it. Love shouldn't feel like this. A fourth marker is belittling. (Video) Blue: Wanna hang out?
Orange: I gotta study. Blue: You'll get an A anyway,
A for amazing. (#thatslove) Blue: Wanna hang out?
Orange: I gotta study. Blue: You'll get an F anyway, F for, F for... stupid. (#thatsnotlove) KH: Yeah, hmm. In unhealthy love,
words are used as weapons. Conversations that used to be
fun and lighthearted turn mean and embarrassing. Maybe your partner makes fun of you
in a way that hurts, or maybe they tell stories and jokes
for laughs at your expense. When you try to explain
that your feelings have been hurt, they shut you down
and accuse you of overreacting. ""Why are you so sensitive?
What's your problem. Give me a break."" You are silenced by these words. It seems pretty obvious,
but your partner should have your back. Their words should build you up,
not break you down. They should keep
your secrets and be loyal. They should make you feel more confident, not less. Finally, a fifth marker: volatility. (Video) Orange 1:
I'd be sad if we broke up. Orange 2: I'd be sad too. (#thatslove) Orange 1: I'd so depressed
if we ever broke up. I'd throw myself off this step. I would! Don't try to stop me! (#thatsnotlove) KH: Frequent breakups and makeups,
high highs and low lows: as tension rises, so does volatility. Tearful, frustrated fights
followed by emotional makeups, hateful and hurtful comments like, ""You're worthless,
I'm not even sure why I'm with you!"" followed quickly by apologies
and promises it will never happen again. By this point, you've been so conditioned
to this relationship roller coaster that you may not realize how unhealthy
and maybe even dangerous your relationship has become. It can be really hard to see when unhealthy love turns towards abuse, but it's fair to say
that the more of these markers your relationship might have, the more unhealthy and maybe dangerous
your relationship could be. And if your instinct is
to break up and leave, which is advice
so many of us give our friends when they're in unhealthy relationships, that's not always the best advice. Time of breakup can be
a real trigger for violence. If you fear you might be
headed towards abuse or in abuse, you need to consult with experts
to get the advice on how to leave safely. But it's not just
about romantic relationships and it's not just about violence. Understanding the signs of unhealthy love can help you audit and understand
nearly every relationship in your life. For the first time, you might understand
why you're disappointed in a friendship or why every interaction
with a certain family member leaves you discouraged and anxious. You might even begin to see
how your own intensity and jealousy is causing problems
with colleagues at work. Understanding is
the first step to improving, and while you can't make
every unhealthy relationship healthy -- some you're going
to have to leave behind -- you can do your part every day
to do relationships better. And here's the exciting news: it's actually not rocket science. Open communication, mutual respect, kindness, patience -- we can practice these things every day. And while practice
will definitely make you better, I have to promise you
it's also not going to make you perfect. I do this for a living and every day I think and talk
about healthy relationships, and still I do unhealthy things. Just the other day as I was trying
to shuttle my four kids out the door amidst quarreling, squabbling
and complaints about breakfast, I completely lost it. With an intentionally angry edge, I screamed, ""Everybody just shut up and do what I say! You are the worst! I am going to take away
screen time and dessert and anything else you could possibly
ever enjoy in life!"" (Laughter) Anybody been there? (Applause) Volatility, belittling. My oldest son turned around
and looked at me, and said, ""Mom, that's not love."" (Laughter) For a minute, I really wanted
to kill him for calling me out. Trust me. But then I gathered myself and I thought, you know what,
I'm actually proud. I'm proud that he has a language
to make me pause. I want all of my kids to understand
what the bar should be for how they're treated and to have a language and a voice
to use when that bar is not met versus just accepting it. For too long, we've treated
relationships as a soft topic, when relationship skills
are one of the most important and hard to build things in life. Not only can understanding unhealthy signs help you avoid the rabbit hole
that leads to unhealthy love, but understanding and practicing
the art of being healthy can improve nearly
every aspect of your life. I'm completely convinced that while love is
an instinct and an emotion, the ability to love better
is a skill we can all build and improve on over time. Thank you. (Applause)",2019-06-11T22:30:59Z
Sleep Is Your Superpower,Matt Walker,14132791,372896,10687,"Sleep is your life-support system and Mother Nature's best effort yet at immortality, says sleep scientist Matt Walker. In this deep ...","Thank you very much. Well, I would like
to start with testicles. (Laughter) Men who sleep five hours a night have significantly smaller testicles
than those who sleep seven hours or more. (Laughter) In addition, men who routinely sleep
just four to five hours a night will have a level of testosterone which is that of someone
10 years their senior. So a lack of sleep
will age a man by a decade in terms of that critical
aspect of wellness. And we see equivalent impairments
in female reproductive health caused by a lack of sleep. This is the best news
that I have for you today. (Laughter) From this point, it may only get worse. Not only will I tell you
about the wonderfully good things that happen when you get sleep, but the alarmingly bad things
that happen when you don't get enough, both for your brain and for your body. Let me start with the brain and the functions of learning and memory, because what we've discovered
over the past 10 or so years is that you need sleep after learning to essentially hit the save button
on those new memories so that you don't forget. But recently, we discovered
that you also need sleep before learning to actually prepare your brain, almost like a dry sponge ready to initially soak up
new information. And without sleep,
the memory circuits of the brain essentially become
waterlogged, as it were, and you can't absorb new memories. So let me show you the data. Here in this study, we decided
to test the hypothesis that pulling the all-nighter
was a good idea. So we took a group of individuals and we assigned them
to one of two experimental groups: a sleep group
and a sleep deprivation group. Now the sleep group, they're going to get
a full eight hours of slumber, but the deprivation group,
we're going to keep them awake in the laboratory, under full supervision. There's no naps or caffeine, by the way,
so it's miserable for everyone involved. And then the next day, we're going to place those participants
inside an MRI scanner and we're going to have them
try and learn a whole list of new facts as we're taking snapshots
of brain activity. And then we're going to test them to see how effective
that learning has been. And that's what you're looking at
here on the vertical axis. And when you put
those two groups head to head, what you find is a quite significant,
40-percent deficit in the ability of the brain
to make new memories without sleep. I think this should be concerning, considering what we know
is happening to sleep in our education populations right now. In fact, to put that in context, it would be the difference
in a child acing an exam versus failing it miserably -- 40 percent. And we've gone on to discover
what goes wrong within your brain to produce these types
of learning disabilities. And there's a structure that sits on the left and the right side
of your brain, called the hippocampus. And you can think of the hippocampus almost like the informational
inbox of your brain. It's very good at receiving
new memory files and then holding on to them. And when you look at this structure in those people who'd had
a full night of sleep, we saw lots of healthy
learning-related activity. Yet in those people
who were sleep-deprived, we actually couldn't find
any significant signal whatsoever. So it's almost as though sleep deprivation
had shut down your memory inbox, and any new incoming files --
they were just being bounced. You couldn't effectively
commit new experiences to memory. So that's the bad that can happen
if I were to take sleep away from you, but let me just come back
to that control group for a second. Do you remember those folks
that got a full eight hours of sleep? Well, we can ask
a very different question: What is it about the physiological
quality of your sleep when you do get it that restores and enhances
your memory and learning ability each and every day? And by placing electrodes
all over the head, what we've discovered
is that there are big, powerful brainwaves that happen during
the very deepest stages of sleep that have riding on top of them these spectacular bursts
of electrical activity that we call sleep spindles. And it's the combined quality
of these deep-sleep brainwaves that acts like a file-transfer
mechanism at night, shifting memories from a short-term
vulnerable reservoir to a more permanent long-term
storage site within the brain, and therefore protecting them,
making them safe. And it is important that we understand what during sleep actually transacts
these memory benefits, because there are real medical
and societal implications. And let me just tell you about one area that we've moved this work
out into, clinically, which is the context of aging
and dementia. Because it's of course no secret
that, as we get older, our learning and memory abilities
begin to fade and decline. But what we've also discovered is that a physiological signature of aging
is that your sleep gets worse, especially that deep quality of sleep
that I was just discussing. And only last year,
we finally published evidence that these two things,
they're not simply co-occurring, they are significantly interrelated. And it suggests
that the disruption of deep sleep is an underappreciated factor that is contributing
to cognitive decline or memory decline in aging, and most recently
we've discovered, in Alzheimer's disease as well. Now, I know this is remarkably
depressing news. It's in the mail. It's coming at you. But there's a potential
silver lining here. Unlike many of the other factors
that we know are associated with aging, for example changes
in the physical structure of the brain, that's fiendishly difficult to treat. But that sleep is a missing piece
in the explanatory puzzle of aging and Alzheimer's is exciting because we may be able
to do something about it. And one way that we are
approaching this at my sleep center is not by using
sleeping pills, by the way. Unfortunately, they are blunt instruments
that do not produce naturalistic sleep. Instead, we're actually developing
a method based on this. It's called direct current
brain stimulation. You insert a small amount
of voltage into the brain, so small you typically don't feel it, but it has a measurable impact. Now if you apply this stimulation
during sleep in young, healthy adults, as if you're sort of singing in time
with those deep-sleep brainwaves, not only can you amplify
the size of those deep-sleep brainwaves, but in doing so, we can almost
double the amount of memory benefit that you get from sleep. The question now
is whether we can translate this same affordable,
potentially portable piece of technology into older adults and those with dementia. Can we restore back
some healthy quality of deep sleep, and in doing so, can we salvage
aspects of their learning and memory function? That is my real hope now. That's one of our moon-shot
goals, as it were. So that's an example
of sleep for your brain, but sleep is just
as essential for your body. We've already spoken about sleep loss
and your reproductive system. Or I could tell you about sleep loss
and your cardiovascular system, and that all it takes is one hour. Because there is a global experiment
performed on 1.6 billion people across 70 countries twice a year, and it's called daylight saving time. Now, in the spring,
when we lose one hour of sleep, we see a subsequent 24-percent increase
in heart attacks that following day. In the autumn,
when we gain an hour of sleep, we see a 21-percent
reduction in heart attacks. Isn't that incredible? And you see exactly the same profile
for car crashes, road traffic accidents, even suicide rates. But as a deeper dive,
I want to focus on this: sleep loss and your immune system. And here, I'll introduce these delightful
blue elements in the image. They are called natural killer cells, and you can think of natural killer cells
almost like the secret service agents of your immune system. They are very good at identifying
dangerous, unwanted elements and eliminating them. In fact, what they're doing here
is destroying a cancerous tumor mass. So what you wish for
is a virile set of these immune assassins at all times, and tragically, that's what you don't have
if you're not sleeping enough. So here in this experiment, you're not going to have your sleep
deprived for an entire night, you're simply going to have your sleep
restricted to four hours for one single night, and then we're going to look to see
what's the percent reduction in immune cell activity that you suffer. And it's not small -- it's not 10 percent, it's not 20 percent. There was a 70-percent drop
in natural killer cell activity. That's a concerning state
of immune deficiency, and you can perhaps understand
why we're now finding significant links between
short sleep duration and your risk for the development
of numerous forms of cancer. Currently, that list includes
cancer of the bowel, cancer of the prostate
and cancer of the breast. In fact, the link between a lack of sleep
and cancer is now so strong that the World Health Organization has classified any form
of nighttime shift work as a probable carcinogen, because of a disruption
of your sleep-wake rhythms. So you may have heard of that old maxim that you can sleep when you're dead. Well, I'm being quite serious now -- it is mortally unwise advice. We know this from epidemiological studies
across millions of individuals. There's a simple truth: the shorter your sleep,
the shorter your life. Short sleep predicts all-cause mortality. And if increasing your risk
for the development of cancer or even Alzheimer's disease were not sufficiently disquieting, we have since discovered
that a lack of sleep will even erode the very fabric of biological life itself, your DNA genetic code. So here in this study,
they took a group of healthy adults and they limited them
to six hours of sleep a night for one week, and then they measured the change
in their gene activity profile relative to when those same individuals were getting a full eight hours
of sleep a night. And there were two critical findings. First, a sizable and significant 711 genes were distorted in their activity, caused by a lack of sleep. The second result
was that about half of those genes were actually increased in their activity. The other half were decreased. Now those genes that were switched off
by a lack of sleep were genes associated
with your immune system, so once again, you can see
that immune deficiency. In contrast, those genes
that were actually upregulated or increased by way of a lack of sleep, were genes associated
with the promotion of tumors, genes associated with long-term
chronic inflammation within the body, and genes associated with stress, and, as a consequence,
cardiovascular disease. There is simply no aspect of your wellness that can retreat at the sign
of sleep deprivation and get away unscathed. It's rather like a broken
water pipe in your home. Sleep loss will leak down
into every nook and cranny of your physiology, even tampering with
the very DNA nucleic alphabet that spells out
your daily health narrative. And at this point, you may be thinking, ""Oh my goodness,
how do I start to get better sleep? What are you tips for good sleep?"" Well, beyond avoiding
the damaging and harmful impact of alcohol and caffeine on sleep, and if you're struggling
with sleep at night, avoiding naps during the day, I have two pieces of advice for you. The first is regularity. Go to bed at the same time,
wake up at the same time, no matter whether
it's the weekday or the weekend. Regularity is king, and it will anchor your sleep and improve the quantity
and the quality of that sleep. The second is keep it cool. Your body needs to drop
its core temperature by about two to three degrees
Fahrenheit to initiate sleep and then to stay asleep, and it's the reason
you will always find it easier to fall asleep in a room that's too cold than too hot. So aim for a bedroom temperature
of around 65 degrees, or about 18 degrees Celsius. That's going to be optimal
for the sleep of most people. And then finally,
in taking a step back, then, what is the mission-critical
statement here? Well, I think it may be this: sleep, unfortunately,
is not an optional lifestyle luxury. Sleep is a nonnegotiable
biological necessity. It is your life-support system, and it is Mother Nature's
best effort yet at immortality. And the decimation of sleep
throughout industrialized nations is having a catastrophic impact
on our health, our wellness, even the safety and the education
of our children. It's a silent sleep loss epidemic, and it's fast becoming one of the greatest
public health challenges that we face in the 21st century. I believe it is now time for us
to reclaim our right to a full night of sleep, and without embarrassment or that unfortunate stigma of laziness. And in doing so, we can be reunited
with the most powerful elixir of life, the Swiss Army knife
of health, as it were. And with that soapbox rant over, I will simply say, good night, good luck, and above all ... I do hope you sleep well. Thank you very much indeed. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause) Thank you so much. David Biello: No, no, no.
Stay there for a second. Good job not running away, though.
I appreciate that. So that was terrifying. Matt Walker: You're welcome.
DB: Yes, thank you, thank you. Since we can't catch up on sleep,
what are we supposed to do? What do we do when we're, like,
tossing and turning in bed late at night or doing shift work or whatever else? MW: So you're right,
we can't catch up on sleep. Sleep is not like the bank. You can't accumulate a debt and then hope to pay it off
at a later point in time. I should also note the reason
that it's so catastrophic and that our health
deteriorates so quickly, first, it's because human beings
are the only species that deliberately deprive
themselves of sleep for no apparent reason. DB: Because we're smart. MW: And I make that point
because it means that Mother Nature, throughout the course of evolution, has never had to face the challenge
of this thing called sleep deprivation. So she's never developed a safety net, and that's why when you undersleep, things just sort of implode so quickly,
both within the brain and the body. So you just have to prioritize. DB: OK, but tossing and turning in bed, what do I do? MW: So if you are staying in bed
awake for too long, you should get out of bed
and go to a different room and do something different. The reason is because your brain
will very quickly associate your bedroom with the place of wakefulness, and you need to break that association. So only return to bed when you are sleepy, and that way you will relearn
the association that you once had, which is your bed is the place of sleep. So the analogy would be, you'd never sit at the dinner table,
waiting to get hungry, so why would you lie in bed,
waiting to get sleepy? DB: Well, thank you for that wake-up call. Great job, Matt. MW: You're very welcome.
Thank you very much.",2019-06-03T15:27:56Z
The secrets of learning a new language,Lýdia Machová,10555499,361474,9046,"Visit http://TED.com to get our entire library of TED Talks, transcripts, translations, personalized talk recommendations and more.","I love learning foreign languages. In fact, I love it so much that I like
to learn a new language every two years, currently working on my eighth one. When people find that out about me,
they always ask me, ""How do you do that? What's your secret?"" And to be honest, for many years,
my answer would be, ""I don't know. I simply
love learning languages."" But people were never
happy with that answer. They wanted to know why they are spending
years trying to learn even one language, never achieving fluency, and here I come, learning
one language after another. They wanted to know
the secret of polyglots, people who speak a lot of languages. And that made me wonder, too, how do actually other polyglots do it? What do we have in common? And what is it that enables us to learn languages
so much faster than other people? I decided to meet other people
like me and find that out. The best place to meet a lot of polyglots is an event where hundreds
of language lovers meet in one place
to practice their languages. There are several such polyglot events
organized all around the world, and so I decided to go there and ask polyglots
about the methods that they use. And so I met Benny from Ireland, who told me that his method
is to start speaking from day one. He learns a few phrases
from a travel phrasebook and goes to meet native speakers and starts having conversations
with them right away. He doesn't mind making
even 200 mistakes a day, because that's how he learns,
based on the feedback. And the best thing is, he doesn't
even need to travel a lot today, because you can easily have
conversations with native speakers from the comfort of
your living room, using websites. I also met Lucas from Brazil who had a really interesting
method to learn Russian. He simply added a hundred random
Russian speakers on Skype as friends, and then he opened
a chat window with one of them and wrote ""Hi"" in Russian. And the person replied, ""Hi, how are you?"" Lucas copied this and put it
into a text window with another person, and the person replied,
""I'm fine, thank you, and how are you?"" Lucas copied this
back to the first person, and in this way, he had two strangers
have a conversation with each other without knowing about it. (Laughter) And soon he would start typing himself, because he had so many
of these conversations that he figured out how
the Russian conversation usually starts. What an ingenious method, right? And then I met polyglots who always start
by imitating sounds of the language, and others who always learn the 500
most frequent words of the language, and yet others who always start
by reading about the grammar. If I asked a hundred different polyglots, I heard a hundred different
approaches to learning languages. Everybody seems to have a unique way
they learn a language, and yet we all come to the same result
of speaking several languages fluently. And as I was listening to these polyglots
telling me about their methods, it suddenly dawned on me: the one thing we all have in common is that we simply found ways to enjoy
the language-learning process. All of these polyglots
were talking about language learning as if it was great fun. You should have seen their faces when they were showing me
their colorful grammar charts and their carefully handmade flash cards, and their statistics
about learning vocabulary using apps, or even how they love to cook
based on recipes in a foreign language. All of them use different methods, but they always make sure
it's something that they personally enjoy. I realized that this is actually
how I learn languages myself. When I was learning Spanish,
I was bored with the text in the textbook. I mean, who wants to read about Jose asking about the directions
to the train station. Right? I wanted to read ""Harry Potter"" instead, because that was
my favorite book as a child, and I have read it many times. So I got the Spanish translation
of ""Harry Potter"" and started reading, and sure enough, I didn't understand
almost anything at the beginning, but I kept on reading
because I loved the book, and by the end of the book, I was able
to follow it almost without any problems. And the same thing happened
when I was learning German. I decided to watch ""Friends,""
my favorite sitcom, in German, and again, at the beginning
it was all just gibberish. I didn't know where one word finished
and another one started, but I kept on watching every day
because it's ""Friends."" I can watch it in any language.
I love it so much. And after the second or third season, seriously, the dialogue
started to make sense. I only realized this
after meeting other polyglots. We are no geniuses and we have no shortcut
to learning languages. We simply found ways
how to enjoy the process, how to turn language learning
from a boring school subject into a pleasant activity
which you don't mind doing every day. If you don't like writing
words down on paper, you can always type them in an app. If you don't like listening
to boring textbook material, find interesting content on YouTube
or in podcasts for any language. If you're a more introverted person and you can't imagine speaking
to native speakers right away, you can apply the method of self-talk. You can talk to yourself
in the comfort of your room, describing your plans for the weekend,
how your day has been, or even take a random
picture from your phone and describe the picture
to your imaginary friend. This is how polyglots learn languages, and the best news is,
it's available to anyone who is willing to take the learning
into their own hands. So meeting other polyglots
helped me realize that it is really crucial
to find enjoyment in the process of learning languages, but also that joy in itself is not enough. If you want to achieve fluency
in a foreign language, you'll also need to apply
three more principles. First of all, you'll need
effective methods. If you try to memorize a list of words
for a test tomorrow, the words will be stored
in your short-term memory and you'll forget them after a few days. If you, however,
want to keep words long term, you need to revise them
in the course of a few days repeatedly using the so-called space repetition. You can use apps which are based
on this system such as Anki or Memrise, or you can write lists of word
in a notebook using the Goldlist method, which is also very popular
with many polyglots. If you're not sure which methods are
effective and what is available out there, just check out polyglots'
YouTube channels and websites and get inspiration from them. If it works for them,
it will most probably work for you too. The third principle to follow is to create a system in your learning. We're all very busy and no one
really has time to learn a language today. But we can create that time
if we just plan a bit ahead. Can you wake up 15 minutes earlier
than you normally do? That would be the perfect time
to revise some vocabulary. Can you listen to a podcast
on your way to work while driving? Well, that would be great
to get some listening experience. There are so many things we can do
without even planning that extra time, such as listening to podcasts
on our way to work or doing our household chores. The important thing is
to create a plan in the learning. ""I will practice speaking
every Tuesday and Thursday with a friend for 20 minutes. I will listen to a YouTube video
while having breakfast."" If you create a system in your learning, you don't need to find that extra time, because it will become
a part of your everyday life. And finally, if you want to learn
a language fluently, you need also a bit of patience. It's not possible to learn
a language within two months, but it's definitely possible to make
a visible improvement in two months, if you learn in small chunks every day
in a way that you enjoy. And there is nothing
that motivates us more than our own success. I vividly remember the moment when I understood the first joke
in German when watching ""Friends."" I was so happy and motivated that I just kept on watching that day
two more episodes, and as I kept watching, I had more and more of those moments
of understanding, these little victories, and step by step, I got to a level
where I could use the language freely and fluently to express anything. This is a wonderful feeling. I can't get enough of that feeling, and that's why I learn
a language every two years. So this is the whole polyglot secret. Find effective methods
which you can use systematically over the period of some time
in a way which you enjoy, and this is how polyglots learn
languages within months, not years. Now, some of you may be thinking, ""That's all very nice
to enjoy language learning, but isn't the real secret
that you polyglots are just super talented
and most of us aren't?"" Well, there's one thing
I haven't told you about Benny and Lucas. Benny had 11 years of Irish Gaelic
and five years of German at school. He couldn't speak them
at all when graduating. Up to the age of 21, he thought
he didn't have the language gene and he could not speak another language. Then he started to look
for his way of learning languages, which was speaking to native speakers
and getting feedback from them, and today Benny can easily
have a conversation in 10 languages. Lucas tried to learn English
at school for 10 years. He was one of the worst students in class. His friends even made fun of him and gave him a Russian textbook as a joke because they thought he would never
learn that language, or any language. And then Lucas started
to experiment with methods, looking for his own way to learn, for example, by having Skype chat
conversations with strangers. And after just 10 years, Lucas is able to speak
11 languages fluently. Does that sound like a miracle? Well, I see such miracles
every single day. As a language mentor, I help people learn
languages by themselves, and I see this every day. People struggle with language learning
for five, 10, even 20 years, and then they suddenly take
their learning into their own hands, start using materials which they enjoy,
more effective methods, or they start tracking their learning so that they can appreciate
their own progress, and that's when suddenly they magically find the language talent
that they were missing all their lives. So if you've also tried
to learn a language and you gave up,
thinking it's too difficult or you don't have the language talent, give it another try. Maybe you're also
just one enjoyable method away from learning that language fluently. Maybe you're just one method away
from becoming a polyglot. Thank you. (Applause)",2019-01-24T15:48:45Z
"How I climbed a 3,000-foot vertical cliff -- without ropes",Alex Honnold,10694208,192053,8872,"Visit http://TED.com to get our entire library of TED Talks, transcripts, translations, personalized talk recommendations and more.","Hello. I'd like to show you guys
30 seconds of the best day of my life. (Applause) So that was El Capitan
in California's Yosemite National Park, and in case you couldn't tell, I was climbing by myself without a rope, a style of a climbing
known as free soloing. That was the culmination
of a nearly decade-long dream, and in the video I'm over
2,500 feet off the ground. Seems scary? Yeah, it is, which is why I spent so many years
dreaming about soloing El Cap and not actually doing it. But on the day that that video was taken, it didn't feel scary at all. It felt as comfortable and natural
as a walk in the park, which is what most folks
were doing in Yosemite that day. Today I'd like to talk about
how I was able to feel so comfortable and how I overcame my fear. I'll start with a very brief version
of how I became a climber, and then tell the story
of my two most significant free solos. They were both successful,
which is why I'm here. (Laughter) But the first felt largely unsatisfying, whereas the second, El Cap, was by far
the most fulfilling day of my life. Through these two climbs,
you'll see my process for managing fear. So I started climbing in a gym
when I was around 10 years old, which means that my life
has been centered on climbing for more than 20 years. After nearly a decade
of climbing mostly indoors, I made the transition to the outdoors
and gradually started free soloing. I built up my comfort over time and slowly took on
bigger and more challenging walls. And there have been
many free soloists before me, so I had plenty of
inspiration to draw from. But by 2008, I'd repeated
most of their previous solos in Yosemite and was starting to imagine
breaking into new terrain. The obvious first choice was Half Dome, an iconic 2,000-foot wall that
lords over the east end of the valley. The problem, though also the allure, was that it was too big. I didn't really know how to prepare
for a potential free solo. So I decided to skip the preparations and just go up there
and have an adventure. I figured I would rise to the occasion, which, unsurprisingly,
was not the best strategy. I did at least climb the route
roped up with a friend two days before just to make sure
that I knew roughly where to go and that I could physically do it. But when I came back
by myself two days later, I decided that I didn't
want to go that way. I knew that there was a 300-foot variation that circled around
one of the hardest parts of the climb. I suddenly decided to skip the hard part
and take the variation, even though I'd never climbed it before, but I immediately began to doubt myself. Imagine being by yourself
in the dead center of a 2,000-foot face, wondering if you're lost. (Laughter) Thankfully, it was
pretty much the right way and I circled back to the route. I was slightly rattled,
I was pretty rattled, but I tried not to let it
bother me too much because I knew that all the hardest
climbing was up at the top. I needed to stay composed. It was a beautiful September morning,
and as I climbed higher, I could hear the sounds of tourists
chatting and laughing on the summit. They'd all hiked up
the normal trail on the back, which I was planning on using
for my descent. But between me and the summit
lay a blank slab of granite. There were no cracks
or edges to hold on to, just small ripples of texture
up a slightly less than vertical wall. I had to trust my life to the friction
between my climbing shoes and the smooth granite. I carefully balanced my way upward, shifting my weight back and forth
between the small smears. But then I reached a foothold
that I didn't quite trust. Two days ago, I'd have just
stepped right up on it, but that would have been with a rope on. Now it felt too small and too slippery. I doubted that my foot
would stay on if I weighted it. I considered a foot further to the side,
which seemed worse. I switched my feet and tried
a foot further out. It seemed even worse. I started to panic. I could hear people laughing
on the summit just above me. I wanted to be anywhere but on that slab. My mind was racing in every direction. I knew what I had to do,
but I was too afraid to do it. I just had to stand up on my right foot. And so after what felt like an eternity,
I accepted what I had to do and I stood up on the right foot, and it didn't slip, and so I didn't die, and that move marked the end
of the hardest climbing. And so I charged from there
towards the summit. And so normally when you summit Half Dome, you have a rope and a bunch
of climbing gear on you, and tourists gasp and they
flock around you for photos. This time I popped over the edge
shirtless, panting, jacked. I was amped, but nobody batted an eye. (Laughter) I looked like a lost hiker
that was too close to the edge. I was surrounded by people
talking on cell phones and having picnics. I felt like I was in a mall. (Laughter) I took off my tight climbing shoes
and started hiking back down, and that's when people stopped me. ""You're hiking barefoot?
That's so hard-core."" (Laughter) I didn't bother to explain, but that night in my climbing journal,
I duly noted my free solo of Half Dome, but I included a frowny face
and a comment, ""Do better?"" I'd succeeded in the solo and it was celebrated
as a big first in climbing. Some friends later made a film about it. But I was unsatisfied. I was disappointed in my performance, because I knew that I had
gotten away with something. I didn't want to be a lucky climber.
I wanted to be a great climber. I actually took the next year or so
off from free soloing, because I knew that I shouldn't
make a habit of relying on luck. But even though
I wasn't soloing very much, I'd already started to think about El Cap. It was always in the back of my mind
as the obvious crown jewel of solos. It's the most striking wall in the world. Each year, for the next seven years, I'd think, ""This is the year
that I'm going to solo El Cap."" And then I would drive into Yosemite,
look up at the wall, and think, ""No frickin' way."" (Laughter) It's too big and too scary. But eventually I came to accept that
I wanted to test myself against El Cap. It represented true mastery, but I needed it to feel different. I didn't want to get away with anything
or barely squeak by. This time I wanted to do it right. The thing that makes El Cap
so intimidating is the sheer scale of the wall. Most climbers take three to five days to ascend the 3,000 feet
of vertical granite. The idea of setting out
up a wall of that size with nothing but shoes and
a chalk bag seemed impossible. 3,000 feet of climbing represents thousands of distinct
hand and foot movements, which is a lot to remember. Many of the moves I knew
through sheer repetition. I'd climbed El Cap maybe 50 times
over the previous decade with a rope. But this photo shows my preferred
method of rehearsing the moves. I'm on the summit, about to rappel down the face
with over a thousand feet of rope to spend the day practicing. Once I found sequences
that felt secure and repeatable, I had to memorize them. I had to make sure that they were
so deeply ingrained within me that there was no possibility of error. I didn't want to be wondering
if I was going the right way or using the best holds. I needed everything to feel automatic. Climbing with a rope
is a largely physical effort. You just have to be strong enough
to hold on and make the movements upward. But free soloing
plays out more in the mind. The physical effort is largely the same. Your body is still climbing the same wall. But staying calm
and performing at your best when you know that
any mistake could mean death requires a certain kind of mindset. (Laughter) That's not supposed to be funny,
but if it is, it is. (Laughter) I worked to cultivate that mindset
through visualization, which basically just means imagining
the entire experience of soloing the wall. Partially, that was to help me
remember all the holds, but mostly visualization
was about feeling the texture of each hold in my hand and imagining the sensation of my leg
reaching out and placing my foot just so. I'd imagine it all like a choreographed
dance thousands of feet up. The most difficult part of the whole route
was called the Boulder Problem. It was about 2,000 feet off the ground and consisted of the hardest
physical moves on the whole route: long pulls between poor handholds
with very small, slippery feet. This is what I mean by a poor handhold: an edge smaller than the width
of a pencil but facing downward that I had to press up into with my thumb. But that wasn't even the hardest part. The crux culminated in a karate kick with my left foot over to the inside
of an adjacent corner, a maneuver that required a high degree
of precision and flexibility, enough so that I'd been doing
a nightly stretching routine for a full year ahead of time to make sure that I could comfortably
make the reach with my leg. As I practiced the moves, my visualization turned
to the emotional component of a potential solo. Basically, what if I got up there
and it was too scary? What if I was too tired? What if I couldn't quite make the kick? I had to consider every possibility
while I was safely on the ground, so that when the time came and I was
actually making the moves without a rope, there was no room for doubt to creep in. Doubt is the precursor to fear, and I knew that I couldn't experience
my perfect moment if I was afraid. I had to visualize and rehearse
enough to remove all doubt. But beyond that, I also
visualized how it would feel if it never seemed doable. What if, after so much work,
I was afraid to try? What if I was wasting my time and I would never feel comfortable
in such an exposed position? There were no easy answers, but El Cap meant enough to me
that I would put in the work and find out. Some of my preparations were more mundane. This is a photo of my friend Conrad Anker climbing up the bottom of El Cap
with an empty backpack. We spent the day climbing together to a specific crack
in the middle of the wall that was choked with loose rocks that made that section
difficult and potentially dangerous, because any missed step
might knock a rock to the ground and kill a passing climber or hiker. So we carefully removed the rocks,
loaded them into the pack and rappelled back down. Take a second to imagine
how ridiculous it feels to climb 1,500 feet up a wall
just to fill a backpack full of rocks. (Laughter) It's never that easy to carry
a pack full of rocks around. It's even harder on the side of a cliff. It may have felt silly,
but it still had to get done. I needed everything to feel perfect if I was ever going to climb
the route without a rope. After two seasons of working specifically
toward a potential free solo of El Cap, I finally finished all my preparations. I knew every handhold
and foothold on the whole route, and I knew exactly what to do. Basically, I was ready. It was time to solo El Cap. On June 3, 2017, I woke up early, ate my usual
breakfast of muesli and fruit and made it to the base
of the wall before sunrise. I felt confident as I looked up the wall. I felt even better as I started climbing. About 500 feet up, I reached a slab very similar to the one that had
given me so much trouble on Half Dome, but this time was different. I'd scouted every option, including
hundreds of feet of wall to either side. I knew exactly what to do
and how to do it. I had no doubts.
I just climbed right through. Even the difficult and strenuous
sections passed by with ease. I was perfectly executing my routine. I rested for a moment
below the Boulder Problem and then climbed it just as I had
practiced so many times with the rope on. My foot shot across to the wall
on the left without hesitation, and I knew that I had done it. Climbing Half Dome had been a big goal and I did it, but I didn't get what I really wanted. I didn't achieve mastery. I was hesitant and afraid, and it wasn't
the experience that I wanted. But El Cap was different. With 600 feet to go, I felt like the
mountain was offering me a victory lap. I climbed with a smooth precision and enjoyed the sounds of the birds
swooping around the cliff. It all felt like a celebration. And then I reached the summit after three hours and 56 minutes
of glorious climbing. It was the climb that I wanted,
and it felt like mastery. Thank you. (Applause)",2018-10-29T14:58:22Z
Why the secret to success is setting the right goals,John Doerr,2378971,38104,673,"Our leaders and institutions are failing us, but it's not always because they're bad or unethical, says venture capitalist John Doerr ...","We're at a critical moment. Our leaders, some of our great institutions are failing us. Why? In some cases, it's because they're bad or unethical, but often, they've taken us
to the wrong objectives. And this is unacceptable. This has to stop. How are we going to correct these wrongs? How are we going
to choose the right course? It's not going to be easy. For years, I've worked with talented teams and they've chosen the right objectives
and the wrong objectives. Many have succeeded,
others of them have failed. And today I'm going to share with you what really makes a difference -- that's what's crucial, how and why they set meaningful and audacious goals, the right goals for the right reasons. Let's go back to 1975. Yep, this is me. I've got a lot to learn,
I'm a computer engineer, I've got long hair, but I'm working under Andy Grove, who's been called the greatest manager
of his or any other era. Andy was a superb leader
and also a teacher, and he said to me, ""John,
it almost doesn't matter what you know. Execution is what matters the most."" And so Andy invented a system
called ""Objectives and Key Results."" It kind of rolls off
the tongue, doesn't it? And it's all about excellent execution. So here's a classic video from the 1970s of professor Andy Grove. (Video) Andy Grove: The two key phrases
of the management by objective systems are the objectives and the key results,
and they match the two purposes. The objective is the direction. The key results have to be measured, but at the end you can look
and without any argument say, ""Did I do that, or did I not do that?""
Yes. No. Simple. John Doerr: That's Andy. Yes. No. Simple. Objectives and Key Results, or OKRs, are a simple goal-setting system and they work for organizations,
they work for teams, they even work for individuals. The objectives are what
you want to have accomplished. The key results are how
I'm going to get that done. Objectives. Key results. What and how. But here's the truth: many of us are setting goals wrong, and most of us
are not setting goals at all. A lot of organizations
set objectives and meet them. They ship their sales,
they introduce their new products, they make their numbers, but they lack a sense of purpose
to inspire their teams. So how do you set
these goals the right way? First, you must answer
the question, ""Why?"" Why? Because truly transformational teams combine their ambitions
to their passion and to their purpose, and they develop a clear
and compelling sense of why. I want to tell you a story. I work with a remarkable entrepreneur. Her name is Jini Kim. She runs a company called Nuna. Nuna is a health care data company. And when Nuna was founded, they used data to serve the health needs
of lots of workers at large companies. And then two years
into the company's life, the federal government issued a proposal to build the first ever
cloud database for Medicaid. Now, you'll remember
that Medicaid is that program that serves 70 million Americans, our poor, our children and people with disabilities. Nuna at the time was just 15 people and this database
had to be built in one year, and they had a whole set of commitments
that they had to honor, and frankly, they weren't going to make
very much money on the project. This was a bet-your-company moment, and Jini seized it. She jumped at the opportunity.
She did not flinch. Why? Well, it's a personal why. Jini's younger brother Kimong has autism. And when he was seven, he had his first grand mal seizure at Disneyland. He fell to the ground.
He stopped breathing. Jini's parents are Korean immigrants. They came to the country
with limited resources speaking little English, so it was up to Jini
to enroll her family in Medicaid. She was nine years old. That moment defined her mission, and that mission became her company, and that company bid on, won
and delivered on that contract. Here's Jini to tell you why. (Video) Jini Kim: Medicaid
saved my family from bankruptcy, and today it provides for Kimong's health
and for millions of others. Nuna is my love letter to Medicaid. Every row of data is a life whose story deserves
to be told with dignity. JD: And Jini's story tells us that a compelling sense of why
can be the launchpad for our objectives. Remember, that's what
we want to have accomplished. And objectives are significant, they're action-oriented, they are inspiring, and they're a kind of vaccine
against fuzzy thinking. You think a rockstar would be an unlikely user
of Objectives and Key Results, but for years, Bono has used OKRs to wage a global war
against poverty and disease, and his ONE organization
has focused on two really gorgeous, audacious objectives. The first is debt relief for the poorest countries in the world. The next is universal access
to anti-HIV drugs. Now, why are these good objectives? Let's go back to our checklist. Significant? Check. Concrete? Yes. Action-oriented? Yes. Inspirational? Well, let's just listen to Bono. (Video) Bono: So you're passionate? How passionate? What actions does your passion
lead you to do? If the heart doesn't find
a perfect rhyme with the head, then your passion means nothing. The OKR framework cultivates the madness, the chemistry contained inside it. It gives us an environment for risk, for trust, where failing is not a fireable offense. And when you have that sort
of structure and environment and the right people, magic is around the corner. JD: I love that. OKRs cultivate the madness, and magic is right around the corner. This is perfect. So with Jini we've covered the whys, with Bono the whats of goal-setting. Let's turn our attention to the hows. Remember, the hows are the key results. That's how we meet our objectives. And good results
are specific and time-bound. They're aggressive but realistic. They're measurable,
and they're verifiable. Those are good key results. In 1999, I introduced OKRs
to Google's cofounders, Larry and Sergey. Here they are,
24 years old in their garage. And Sergey enthusiastically
said he'd adopt them. Well, not quite. What he really said was, ""We don't have any other way
to manage this company, so we'll give it a go."" (Laughter) And I took that as a kind of endorsement. But every quarter since then, every Googler has written down
her objectives and her key results. They've graded them, and they've published them
for everyone to see. And these are not used
for bonuses or for promotions. They're set aside. They're used for a higher purpose, and that's to get collective commitment to truly stretch goals. In 2008, a Googler, Sundar Pichai,
took on an objective which was to build
the next generation client platform for the future of web applications -- in other words, build the best browser. He was very thoughtful
about how he chose his key results. How do you measure the best browser? It could be ad clicks or engagement. No. He said: numbers of users, because users are going to decide if Chrome is a great browser or not. So he had this one
three-year-long objective: build the best browser. And then every year
he stuck to the same key results, numbers of users, but he upped the ante. In the first year,
his goal was 20 million users and he missed it. He got less than 10. Second year, he raised
the bar to 50 million. He got to 37 million users. Somewhat better. In the third year, he upped the ante once more
to a hundred million. He launched an aggressive
marketing campaign, broader distribution,
improved the technology, and kaboom! He got 111 million users. Here's why I like this story, not so much for the happy ending, but it shows someone
carefully choosing the right objective and then sticking to it
year after year after year. It's a perfect story for a nerd like me. Now, I think of OKRs
as transparent vessels that are made from the whats
and hows of our ambitions. What really matters is the why
that we pour into those vessels. That's why we do our work. OKRs are not a silver bullet. They're not going to be
a substitute for a strong culture or for stronger leadership, but when those fundamentals are in place,
they can take you to the mountaintop. I want you to think
about your life for a moment. Do you have the right metrics? Take time to write down your values, your objectives and your key results. Do it today. If you'd like some feedback on them,
you can send them to me. I'm john@whatmatters.com. If we think of the world-changing goals of an Intel, of a Nuna, of Bono, of Google, they're remarkable: ubiquitous computing, affordable health care,
high-quality for everyone, ending global poverty, access to all the world's information. Here's the deal: every one of those goals
is powered today by OKRs. Now, I've been called
the Johnny Appleseed of OKRs for spreading the good gospel
according to Andy Grove, but I want you
to join me in this movement. Let's fight for what it is
that really matters, because we can take OKRs
beyond our businesses. We can take them to our families, to our schools, even to our governments. We can hold those governments accountable. We can transform those informations. We can get back on the right track if we can and do measure
what really matters. Thank you. (Applause)",2018-07-02T19:14:56Z
The brain-changing benefits of exercise,Wendy Suzuki,10432915,348298,7644,What's the most transformative thing that you can do for your brain today? Exercise! says neuroscientist Wendy Suzuki.,"What if I told you there was something
that you can do right now that would have an immediate,
positive benefit for your brain including your mood and your focus? And what if I told you that same thing
could actually last a long time and protect your brain
from different conditions like depression,
Alzheimer's disease or dementia. Would you do it? Yes! I am talking about the powerful effects
of physical activity. Simply moving your body, has immediate, long-lasting
and protective benefits for your brain. And that can last
for the rest of your life. So what I want to do today
is tell you a story about how I used my deep
understanding of neuroscience, as a professor of neuroscience, to essentially do an experiment on myself in which I discovered
the science underlying why exercise
is the most transformative thing that you can do for your brain today. Now, as a neuroscientist,
I know that our brains, that is the thing in our head right now, that is the most complex structure
known to humankind. But it's one thing
to talk about the brain, and it's another to see it. So here is a real preserved human brain. And it's going to illustrate two key areas
that we are going to talk about today. The first is the prefrontal cortex,
right behind your forehead, critical for things like decision-making,
focus, attention and your personality. The second key area is located
in the temporal lobe, shown right here. You have two temporal lobes in your brain,
the right and the left, and deep in the temporal lobe
is a key structure critical for your ability to form and retain new long-term
memories for facts and events. And that structure
is called the hippocampus. So I've always been fascinated
with the hippocampus. How could it be that an event
that lasts just a moment, say, your first kiss, or the moment your first child was born, can form a memory
that has changed your brain, that lasts an entire lifetime? That's what I want to understand. I wanted to start and record
the activity of individual brain cells in the hippocampus as subjects were forming new memories. And essentially try and decode how
those brief bursts of electrical activity, which is how neurons
communicate with each other, how those brief bursts either allowed us
to form a new memory, or did not. But a few years ago,
I did something very unusual in science. As a full professor of neural science, I decided to completely switch
my research program. Because I encountered something
that was so amazing, with the potential to change so many lives that I had to study it. I discovered and I experienced
the brain-changing effects of exercise. And I did it in a completely
inadvertent way. I was actually at the height
of all the memory work that I was doing -- data was pouring in, I was becoming known in my field
for all of this memory work. And it should have been going great.
It was, scientifically. But when I stuck my head
out of my lab door, I noticed something. I had no social life. I spent too much time
listening to those brain cells in a dark room, by myself. (Laughter) I didn't move my body at all. I had gained 25 pounds. And actually, it took me
many years to realize it, I was actually miserable. And I shouldn't be miserable. And I went on a river-rafting trip --
by myself, because I had no social life. And I came back -- (Laughter) thinking, ""Oh, my God,
I was the weakest person on that trip."" And I came back with a mission. I said, ""I'm never going to feel
like the weakest person on a river-rafting trip again."" And that's what made me go to the gym. And I focused my type-A personality on going to all the exercise
classes at the gym. I tried everything. I went to kickbox,
dance, yoga, step class, and at first it was really hard. But what I noticed is that after every
sweat-inducing workout that I tried, I had this great mood boost
and this great energy boost. And that's what kept me
going back to the gym. Well, I started feeling stronger. I started feeling better,
I even lost that 25 pounds. And now, fast-forward a year and a half
into this regular exercise program and I noticed something that really
made me sit up and take notice. I was sitting at my desk,
writing a research grant, and a thought went through my mind that had never gone
through my mind before. And that thought was, ""Gee, grant-writing is going well today."" And all the scientists -- (Laughter) yeah, all the scientists
always laugh when I say that, because grant-writing never goes well. It is so hard; you're always
pulling your hair out, trying to come up with that
million-dollar-winning idea. But I realized that
the grant-writing was going well, because I was able
to focus and maintain my attention for longer than I had before. And my long-term memory --
what I was studying in my own lab -- seemed to be better in me. And that's when I put it together. Maybe all that exercise
that I had included and added to my life was changing my brain. Maybe I did an experiment on myself
without even knowing it. So as a curious neuroscientist, I went to the literature to see
what I could find about what we knew about the effects
of exercise on the brain. And what I found was an exciting
and a growing literature that was essentially showing everything
that I noticed in myself. Better mood, better energy,
better memory, better attention. And the more I learned, the more I realized
how powerful exercise was. Which eventually
led me to the big decision to completely shift my research focus. And so now, after several years
of really focusing on this question, I've come to the following conclusion: that exercise is
the most transformative thing that you can do for your brain today for the following three reasons. Number one: it has
immediate effects on your brain. A single workout that you do will immediately increase
levels of neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin
and noradrenaline. That is going to increase your mood
right after that workout, exactly what I was feeling. My lab showed that a single workout can improve your ability
to shift and focus attention, and that focus improvement
will last for at least two hours. And finally, studies have shown that a single workout
will improve your reaction times which basically means that you are going to be faster
at catching that cup of Starbucks that falls off the counter, which is very, very important. (Laughter) But these immediate effects are transient,
they help you right after. What you have to do is do what I did, that is change your exercise regime,
increase your cardiorespiratory function, to get the long-lasting effects. And these effects are long-lasting because exercise actually
changes the brain's anatomy, physiology and function. Let's start with my favorite
brain area, the hippocampus. The hippocampus -- or exercise actually
produces brand new brain cells, new brain cells in the hippocampus,
that actually increase its volume, as well as improve
your long-term memory, OK? And that including in you and me. Number two: the most common finding
in neuroscience studies, looking at effects of long-term exercise, is improved attention function
dependent on your prefrontal cortex. You not only get
better focus and attention, but the volume of the hippocampus
increases as well. And finally, you not only get
immediate effects of mood with exercise but those last for a long time. So you get long-lasting increases
in those good mood neurotransmitters. But really, the most transformative thing
that exercise will do is its protective effects on your brain. Here you can think
about the brain like a muscle. The more you're working out, the bigger and stronger your hippocampus
and prefrontal cortex gets. Why is that important? Because the prefrontal cortex
and the hippocampus are the two areas that are most
susceptible to neurodegenerative diseases and normal cognitive decline in aging. So with increased exercise
over your lifetime, you're not going to cure
dementia or Alzheimer's disease, but what you're going to do
is you're going to create the strongest, biggest hippocampus
and prefrontal cortex so it takes longer for these diseases
to actually have an effect. You can think of exercise, therefore, as a supercharged 401K for your brain, OK? And it's even better, because it's free. So this is the point in the talk
where everybody says, ""That sounds so interesting, Wendy, but I really will only
want to know one thing. And that is, just tell me
the minimum amount of exercise I need to get all these changes."" (Laughter) And so I'm going to tell you
the answer to that question. First, good news: you don't have to become
a triathlete to get these effects. The rule of thumb is you want to get
three to four times a week exercise minimum 30 minutes an exercise session, and you want to get aerobic exercise in. That is, get your heart rate up. And the good news is,
you don't have to go to the gym to get a very expensive gym membership. Add an extra walk around the block
in your power walk. You see stairs -- take stairs. And power-vacuuming can be as good
as the aerobics class that you were going to take at the gym. So I've gone from memory pioneer to exercise explorer. From going into the innermost
workings of the brain, to trying to understand how exercise
can improve our brain function, and my goal in my lab right now is to go beyond that rule of thumb
that I just gave you -- three to four times a week, 30 minutes. I want to understand
the optimum exercise prescription for you, at your age,
at your fitness level, for your genetic background, to maximize the effects of exercise today and also to improve your brain
and protect your brain the best for the rest of your life. But it's one thing to talk about exercise,
and it's another to do it. So I'm going to invoke my power
as a certified exercise instructor, to ask you all to stand up. (Laughter) We're going to do
just one minute of exercise. It's call-and-response,
just do what I do, say what I say, and make sure you don't punch
your neighbor, OK? Music! (Upbeat music) Five, six, seven, eight,
it's right, left, right, left. And I say, I am strong now. Let's hear you. Audience: I am strong now. Wendy Suzuki: Ladies,
I am Wonder Woman-strong. Let's hear you! Audience: I am Wonder Woman-strong. WS: New move -- uppercut, right and left. I am inspired now. You say it! Audience: I am inspired now. WS: Last move -- pull it down,
right and left, right and left. I say, I am on fire now! You say it. Audience: I am on fire now. WS: And done! OK, good job! (Applause) Thank you. I want to leave you with one last thought. And that is, bringing
exercise in your life will not only give you
a happier, more protective life today, but it will protect your brain
from incurable diseases. And in this way it will change
the trajectory of your life for the better. Thank you very much. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)",2018-03-21T14:53:46Z
How to fix a broken heart,Guy Winch,11026966,404063,28504,"Visit http://TED.com to get our entire library of TED Talks, transcripts, translations, personalized talk recommendations and more.","At some point in our lives, almost every one of us
will have our heart broken. My patient Kathy planned her wedding
when she was in middle school. She would meet her future husband by age 27, get engaged a year later and get married a year after that. But when Kathy turned 27,
she didn't find a husband. She found a lump in her breast. She went through many months
of harsh chemotherapy and painful surgeries, and then just as she was ready
to jump back into the dating world, she found a lump in her other breast and had to do it all over again. Kathy recovered, though, and she was eager to resume
her search for a husband as soon as her eyebrows grew back in. When you're going
on first dates in New York City, you need to be able to express
a wide range of emotions. (Laughter) Soon afterwards,
she met Rich and fell in love. The relationship was everything
she hoped it would be. Six months later, after a lovely weekend in New England, Rich made reservations
at their favorite romantic restaurant. Kathy knew he was going to propose, and she could barely
contain her excitement. But Rich did not propose
to Kathy that night. He broke up with her. As deeply as he cared
for Kathy -- and he did -- he simply wasn't in love. Kathy was shattered. Her heart was truly broken,
and she now faced yet another recovery. But five months after the breakup, Kathy still couldn't stop
thinking about Rich. Her heart was still very much broken. The question is: Why? Why was this incredibly strong
and determined woman unable to marshal the same
emotional resources that got her through four years
of cancer treatments? Why do so many of us flounder when we're trying
to recover from heartbreak? Why do the same coping mechanisms that get us through all kinds
of life challenges fail us so miserably
when our heart gets broken? In over 20 years of private practice, I have seen people
of every age and background face every manner of heartbreak, and what I've learned is this: when your heart is broken, the same instincts you ordinarily rely on will time and again lead you
down the wrong path. You simply cannot trust
what your mind is telling you. For example, we know from studies
of heartbroken people that having a clear understanding
of why the relationship ended is really important
for our ability to move on. Yet time and again, when we are offered a simple
and honest explanation like the one Rich offered Kathy, we reject it. Heartbreak creates
such dramatic emotional pain, our mind tells us the cause
must be equally dramatic. And that gut instinct is so powerful, it can make even the most reasonable
and measured of us come up with mysteries
and conspiracy theories where none exist. Kathy became convinced
something must have happened during her romantic getaway with Rich that soured him on the relationship, and she became obsessed
with figuring out what that was. And so she spent countless hours going through every minute
of that weekend in her mind, searching her memory for clues
that were not there. Kathy's mind tricked her
into initiating this wild goose chase. But what compelled her to commit to it
for so many months? Heartbreak is far more insidious
than we realize. There is a reason we keep going
down one rabbit hole after another, even when we know it's going
to make us feel worse. Brain studies have shown that the withdrawal of romantic love activates the same mechanisms
in our brain that get activated when addicts are withdrawing
from substances like cocaine or opioids. Kathy was going through withdrawal. And since she could not have
the heroin of actually being with Rich, her unconscious mind chose
the methadone of her memories with him. Her instincts told her
she was trying to solve a mystery, but what she was actually doing was getting her fix. This is what makes heartbreak
so difficult to heal. Addicts know they're addicted. They know when they're shooting up. But heartbroken people do not. But you do now. And if your heart is broken,
you cannot ignore that. You have to recognize that,
as compelling as the urge is, with every trip down memory lane,
every text you send, every second you spend
stalking your ex on social media, you are just feeding your addiction, deepening your emotional pain and complicating your recovery. Getting over heartbreak is not a journey. It's a fight, and your reason
is your strongest weapon. There is no breakup explanation
that's going to feel satisfying. No rationale can take away
the pain you feel. So don't search for one,
don't wait for one, just accept the one you were offered
or make up one yourself and then put the question to rest, because you need that closure
to resist the addiction. And you need something else as well: you have to be willing to let go, to accept that it's over. Otherwise, your mind
will feed on your hope and set you back. Hope can be incredibly destructive
when your heart is broken. Heartbreak is a master manipulator. The ease with which it gets our mind
to do the absolute opposite of what we need in order to recover is remarkable. One of the most common tendencies
we have when our heart is broken is to idealize the person who broke it. We spend hours remembering their smile, how great they made us feel, that time we hiked up the mountain
and made love under the stars. All that does is make our loss
feel more painful. We know that. Yet we still allow our mind to cycle
through one greatest hit after another, like we were being held hostage by our own
passive-aggressive Spotify playlist. (Laughter) Heartbreak will make those thoughts
pop into your mind. And so to avoid idealizing,
you have to balance them out by remembering their frown,
not just their smile, how bad they made you feel, the fact that after the lovemaking,
you got lost coming down the mountain, argued like crazy
and didn't speak for two days. What I tell my patients
is to compile an exhaustive list of all the ways
the person was wrong for you, all the bad qualities, all the pet peeves, and then keep it on your phone. (Laughter) And once you have your list, you have to use it. When I hear even a hint of idealizing or the faintest whiff
of nostalgia in a session, I go, ""Phone, please."" (Laughter) Your mind will try to tell you
they were perfect. But they were not,
and neither was the relationship. And if you want to get over them,
you have to remind yourself of that, frequently. None of us is immune to heartbreak. My patient Miguel was a 56-year-old
senior executive in a software company. Five years after his wife died, he finally felt ready
to start dating again. He soon met Sharon, and a whirlwind romance ensued. They introduced each other
to their adult children after one month, and they moved in together after two. When middle-aged people date,
they don't mess around. It's like ""Love, Actually""
meets ""The Fast and the Furious."" (Laughter) Miguel was happier
than he had been in years. But the night before
their first anniversary, Sharon left him. She had decided to move to the West Coast
to be closer to her children, and she didn't want
a long-distance relationship. Miguel was totally blindsided
and utterly devastated. He barely functioned at work
for many, many months, and he almost lost his job as a result. Another consequence of heartbreak
is that feeling alone and in pain can significantly impair
our intellectual functioning, especially when performing complex tasks
involving logic and reasoning. It temporarily lowers our IQ. But it wasn't just the intensity
of Miguel's grief that confused his employers; it was the duration. Miguel was confused by this as well and really quite embarrassed by it. ""What's wrong with me?""
he asked me in our session. ""What adult spends almost a year
getting over a one-year relationship?"" Actually, many do. Heartbreak shares all the hallmarks
of traditional loss and grief: insomnia, intrusive thoughts, immune system dysfunction. Forty percent of people experience
clinically measurable depression. Heartbreak is a complex
psychological injury. It impacts us in a multitude of ways. For example, Sharon was both very social and very active. She had dinners at the house every week. She and Miguel went on camping trips
with other couples. Although Miguel was not religious, he accompanied Sharon
to church every Sunday, where he was welcomed
into the congregation. Miguel didn't just lose his girlfriend; he lost his entire social life, the supportive community
of Sharon's church. He lost his identity as a couple. Now, Miguel recognized the breakup
had left this huge void in his life, but what he failed to recognize is that it left far more than just one. And that is crucial, not just because it explains
why heartbreak could be so devastating, but because it tells us how to heal. To fix your broken heart, you have to identify these voids
in your life and fill them, and I mean all of them. The voids in your identity: you have to reestablish who you are
and what your life is about. The voids in your social life, the missing activities,
even the empty spaces on the wall where pictures used to hang. But none of that will do any good unless you prevent the mistakes
that can set you back, the unnecessary searches for explanations, idealizing your ex instead of focusing
on how they were wrong for you, indulging thoughts and behaviors
that still give them a starring role in this next chapter of your life when they shouldn't be an extra. Getting over heartbreak is hard, but if you refuse to be misled
by your mind and you take steps to heal, you can significantly minimize
your suffering. And it won't just be you
who benefit from that. You'll be more present with your friends, more engaged with your family, not to mention the billions of dollars
of compromised productivity in the workplace that could be avoided. So if you know someone who is heartbroken, have compassion, because social support has been found
to be important for their recovery. And have patience, because it's going to take them longer
to move on than you think it should. And if you're hurting, know this: it's difficult, it is a battle
within your own mind, and you have to be diligent to win. But you do have weapons. You can fight. And you will heal. Thank you. (Applause)",2018-02-27T15:54:10Z
The Thrilling Potential for Off-Grid Solar Energy,Amar Inamdar,267932,4243,314,There's an energy revolution happening in villages and towns across Africa -- off-grid solar energy is becoming a viable ...,"There's something
really incredible happening. So there's over a billion people who have no access to energy
whatsoever across the world, 620 million of them here in Africa. It costs about 1,500 dollars to connect
each household up to the grid. If you are going to wait for it,
it takes about nine years, on average, and that feels like a lifetime
when you're trying to make that happen. That's kind of unbelievable, and it's also unacceptable. So let's do something about it. The lightbulb comes from this idea
that you have an energy system that's made up of the ideas of Tesla and the ideas of Thomas Edison. There was an evolution that said
it's not just about the lightbulb, it's about the whole system, the whole energy system
that goes with that lightbulb, and what happened in that gilded age was the creation of an industrial system that every country around the world
has now started to emulate. So to get to the appliances,
you need to have power stations. From power stations,
you need to have infrastructure, and that infrastructure takes you
to the point of having electricity, and you get to the lightbulbs
and the appliances that we all take for granted. But the amazing thing, in a way,
is that there's a revolution happening in the villages and towns
all around us here in East Africa. And the revolution is an echo
of the cell phone revolution. It's wireless, and that revolution is about solar
and it's about distributed solar. Photons are wireless, they fall on every rooftop, and they generate enough power
to be sufficient for every household need. So that's an incredible thing. There's also a problem with it. Up until now, the technology
hasn't been there to make it happen, and the mindset has been
that we have to have the grid to provide industrial growth and let countries develop
and create jobs and industrialize. So we've gotten ourselves to the point where actually the costs
of building these grids and following that pattern of development are really unsustainable. If you add up the deficits
that all of the utilities run in Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, you get to a number
of 21 billion dollars every year to maintain that system and keep it going. So an extraordinary amount of resources that's been put in to creating a system that ultimately we will have
to wait a very long time for, and when it comes, it often doesn't come
with sufficient robustness to allow us to go down
that path to development. So what a shame. But here's what's happening, and here's the opportunity that I think
we should all get excited about. So there's a group of companies that have been chipping away
at this problem over the last 10 years, and this group of companies have recognized the reality
that there's a great big nuclear reactor up there in the sky, and that Africa is more endowed
with that solar power that comes from the sky, the sun, than almost any other continent. So the opportunity has come
to convert some of that solar power, wireless power, into energy
at the household level. And three things have happened
at the same time. First, the costs of solar
productivity have come down. So putting a panel on your roof
and generating power from it, that cost has absolutely collapsed
over the last 30 years, and it's gone down by 95 percent. Second, the appliance network. So the group of appliances
that we've all gotten used to, we all want and we all need,
we all see as part of our everyday lives that give us health and security, those appliances have come down in cost. So if you take the LED lightbulb,
for example, a very simple thing, they're now 85 percent less
than they were five years ago, and their efficiency, when you
compare them to an incandescent bulb, like the lightbulb I showed
in the previous slide, is incredible. They give you 10 times
the amount of light, and they last 30 times as long. And then the last thing that's happened
is of course the cell phone revolution, so we're piggybacking
off the cell phone revolution, and we can now make decentralized
customers make small payments for bits of equipment and appliances where actually they're now affordable. We can pay them off
over a daily or a weekly schedule. So this is an incredible change
in the economy that's happening, and it's really opened up
something very, very innovative. So I'm going to introduce you
to a lady I met with last week. Her name's Susan. It may not look like it, but Susan is a representative
of a $27 billion market. 27 billion dollars is what people
like Susan spend every year on cell phone charging, flashlight batteries and kerosene
to light their homes. So Susan is a proud owner
of a small solar system. It's a kit rather than a planetary thing, so a small solar system, and her small solar system
allows her to have a couple of lightbulbs, and she's made this transition,
this jump, from kerosene into light. She has four or five lights and a radio. It's fantastic, and she talks about it. She talks about her kids doing homework
at night because she has light. I'm not sure what
the kids feel about that. She talks about the fact that she can
go out at 4am and look after the cows, and she's not so worried, but also, with a little
twinkle in her eye, she talks about how light
turns her house into a home at night. She's not scared
of her own house at night, because it has light in it,
and I thought that was amazing. So Susan does something
that many customers of these companies that I talked about do, and she forces us to innovate. She challenges companies, saying,
""I've got the radio and the lights. You know what? I'd like a TV. I'd like to entertain,
educate me and my kids. And then I would like to have
some hair clippers for my kids, you know, to cut my kids' hair,
and I'd love to have a fridge. And she's coined something that the energy world
is really hungry to do. The idea that she's coined
is the energy ladder. It starts, again, with a lightbulb. Right? And the lightbulb is an idea
that we can get our kids to do homework, and very cheap, about five dollars, and we can get it distributed. But then let's go up from there. This is the kit that Susan has: four lightbulbs, radio,
maybe a little flashlight, a little solar panel on the roof. And then let's go up again. We can get maybe at about 500 dollars, the previous kit was maybe $150, again, paid for over time, two years to pay it all off, you can get the TV, so the lightbulbs and the TV. And you start to ask yourself,
""So where is this headed?"" Is this headed here, where we can have distributed systems with the right infrastructure
to provide power for our hospitals and our schools? And really how far can this go? And this is the mindset shift
that I think is really exciting. How far can we go? Could it get up to here? You know, this is the conceptual design
for one of the world's biggest factories, designed to be fully solar-powered
and fully off grid. Maybe we can get that. So there's a generation of these companies that are out there doing this work
and creating thousands of jobs, creating, selling, tens of thousands
of these solar systems, so bringing tens of thousands
of families into light, and tackling that big $1 billion problem
that I talked about at the beginning, and really innovating. And what they're doing is,
they're not only energy companies, they're also credit finance companies, so they're bringing
people into an economy. They're retail companies, so they're taking products out
to people in the connecting markets. And they're appliance companies, so they're developing
extraordinary products that are very efficient and very cheap. So an extraordinary thing
is happening out there that's worth recognizing. And where does it take us? From a governmental perspective,
from a social perspective, it takes us out to two really big goals. We aspire towards
energy access for everybody, and we aspire towards
a fully-functioning low-carbon economy. And we're getting to the point
where we're seeing the fully-functioning low-carbon economy is not just about
getting people onto the grid, it's about getting people onto electricity and doing it in a way
that's really dignified. So I want us all
to picture it for a moment, really picture what this could mean: [New energy ecosystem] an energy system that's not
just about subsistence power, getting the family off the kerosene, but it's actually the full suite
of appliances and tools and productivity
that we've all gotten used to, so actually energy at a scale
that can drive industrial development. And it's the ability to have
powerful tools. It's the ability to be productive
in the households, as a farmer, or as a carpenter or as a tailor and get your businesses to work
and bring you into the economy. And I was working again
a couple of days ago with a farmer just outside of Nairobi, small field, and he has an irrigation pump
that's run off solar, and he was bragging about
how much of a difference it made to his productivity. When we were listening to him,
we were asking ourselves, at what point will it be that actually, you will be charging
an electric scooter off your rooftop and taking your crops to market with mobility that you've charged
yourself, using your own power? And that's an extraordinary thing
that's happening, and if you listen to Susan and Francis, you get to this point where you say, ""These guys have
this extraordinary sense of dignity about the way they're
achieving their power, the sense of ownership
and the sense of pride, and I'm going to flip
into a little tiny video clip, which is from a distributor of one
of these companies that I'm talking about. And he puts it better
than anyone I've ever heard it. So just listen to this. Martin: So if it does happen
that we get to a point where every home has their own
independent supply of energy, that will give us the democracy of energy. That's it. And everybody has that choice, and everybody knows
when they want to switch it on or off, whether they want to sell access
or whether they want to store it. That freedom getting back
into the hands of the consumer, that would be the most exciting thing. Amar Inamdar: Brilliant, right?
That was Martin, and he has a really
wonderful turn of phrase, and what a sense of vision
that he captures. So picture that for a moment: every household a proud producer
as well as consumer of energy ... the ability to generate power,
to share power, to sell power, all coming from your own generating asset
sitting on your own property. Maybe even think about
crowdsourcing with your neighbors the grid from the ground up, rather than waiting for the government
to bring it from the top down. So in Africa, we have this
extraordinary opportunity right now, an extraordinary opportunity, to change the world
and create an energy system that everybody will be jealous of, and everybody will look to us
as the innovators of. And that's the democracy of energy. Thank you very much. (Applause) Chris Anderson: Quick question. So it's a really exciting vision. Help us understand,
what are the key roadblocks right now? Like, what could make this go faster? AI: So the first one, I think, is really
the intermittency of solar power. So the problem is that the sun
only shines for 12 hours a day, so you've got darkness for 12 hours a day, and we need to have storage solutions that are better to help us
take us down that path. So storage is really one. CA: And those prices are coming down. AI: And those prices
are coming down very quickly. Second, the appliance set. So it needs to get more efficient, and it needs to get more diverse. We need to do more of the things we in Africa want to do
with the appliance set. CA: DC appliances. AI: DC appliances, and I think there's a real
opportunity there, Chris. I think the opportunity is that we could shift some of these
21 billion dollars of subsidies that governments are spending
on the current electricity system and we could promote R&D here in Africa to create some of these products, to be some of these entrepreneurs,
and make this happen. So create this new system here. CA: And some of the companies themselves, I mean, there's plenty of demand there. What's holding them back
from supplying that demand? I mean, some of them talk about, they would like to sell 10x
what they can currently sell. AI: Exactly. So for many
of these capitals, it's that markets don't price
consumer risk very well, and particularly in markets like ours, in emerging markets and here in Africa. So there's not enough working capital
coming into this space because the big financiers
look at this space and say, ""I don't know how to price that risk,
so I'm going to stay away from it."" And that's holding
a lot of these companies back. CA: Well, it's incredibly exciting
to picture what could happen here. In my mind, this might be
the biggest leapfrog of them all. And thank you for all you're doing
and for sharing that vision so powerfully.",2018-02-19T20:13:45Z
Your Brain Hallucinates Your Conscious Reality,Anil Seth,11256791,244330,17129,"Right now, billions of neurons in your brain are working together to generate a conscious experience — and not just any ...","Just over a year ago, for the third time in my life,
I ceased to exist. I was having a small operation,
and my brain was filling with anesthetic. I remember a sense
of detachment and falling apart and a coldness. And then I was back,
drowsy and disoriented, but definitely there. Now, when you wake from a deep sleep, you might feel confused about the time
or anxious about oversleeping, but there's always a basic sense
of time having passed, of a continuity between then and now. Coming round from
anesthesia is very different. I could have been under
for five minutes, five hours, five years or even 50 years. I simply wasn't there. It was total oblivion. Anesthesia --
it's a modern kind of magic. It turns people into objects, and then, we hope, back again into people. And in this process is one of the greatest remaining
mysteries in science and philosophy. How does consciousness happen? Somehow, within each of our brains, the combined activity
of many billions of neurons, each one a tiny biological machine, is generating a conscious experience. And not just any conscious experience -- your conscious experience
right here and right now. How does this happen? Answering this question is so important because consciousness
for each of us is all there is. Without it there's no world, there's no self, there's nothing at all. And when we suffer, we suffer consciously whether it's through
mental illness or pain. And if we can experience
joy and suffering, what about other animals? Might they be conscious, too? Do they also have a sense of self? And as computers get faster and smarter, maybe there will come a point,
maybe not too far away, when my iPhone develops
a sense of its own existence. I actually think the prospects
for a conscious AI are pretty remote. And I think this because
my research is telling me that consciousness has less to do
with pure intelligence and more to do with our nature
as living and breathing organisms. Consciousness and intelligence
are very different things. You don't have to be smart to suffer,
but you probably do have to be alive. In the story I'm going to tell you, our conscious experiences
of the world around us, and of ourselves within it, are kinds of controlled hallucinations that happen with, through
and because of our living bodies. Now, you might have heard
that we know nothing about how the brain and body
give rise to consciousness. Some people even say it's beyond
the reach of science altogether. But in fact, the last 25 years have seen an explosion
of scientific work in this area. If you come to my lab
at the University of Sussex, you'll find scientists
from all different disciplines and sometimes even philosophers. All of us together trying to understand
how consciousness happens and what happens when it goes wrong. And the strategy is very simple. I'd like you to think about consciousness in the way that we've
come to think about life. At one time, people thought
the property of being alive could not be explained
by physics and chemistry -- that life had to be
more than just mechanism. But people no longer think that. As biologists got on with the job of explaining the properties
of living systems in terms of physics and chemistry -- things like metabolism,
reproduction, homeostasis -- the basic mystery of what life is
started to fade away, and people didn't propose
any more magical solutions, like a force of life or an élan vital. So as with life, so with consciousness. Once we start explaining its properties in terms of things happening
inside brains and bodies, the apparently insoluble mystery
of what consciousness is should start to fade away. At least that's the plan. So let's get started. What are the properties of consciousness? What should a science
of consciousness try to explain? Well, for today I'd just like to think
of consciousness in two different ways. There are experiences
of the world around us, full of sights, sounds and smells, there's multisensory, panoramic,
3D, fully immersive inner movie. And then there's conscious self. The specific experience
of being you or being me. The lead character in this inner movie, and probably the aspect of consciousness
we all cling to most tightly. Let's start with experiences
of the world around us, and with the important idea
of the brain as a prediction engine. Imagine being a brain. You're locked inside a bony skull, trying to figure
what's out there in the world. There's no lights inside the skull.
There's no sound either. All you've got to go on
is streams of electrical impulses which are only indirectly related
to things in the world, whatever they may be. So perception --
figuring out what's there -- has to be a process of informed guesswork in which the brain combines
these sensory signals with its prior expectations or beliefs
about the way the world is to form its best guess
of what caused those signals. The brain doesn't hear sound or see light. What we perceive is its best guess
of what's out there in the world. Let me give you a couple
of examples of all this. You might have seen this illusion before, but I'd like you to think
about it in a new way. If you look at those two patches, A and B, they should look to you to be
very different shades of gray, right? But they are in fact
exactly the same shade. And I can illustrate this. If I put up a second version
of the image here and join the two patches
with a gray-colored bar, you can see there's no difference. It's exactly the same shade of gray. And if you still don't believe me, I'll bring the bar across
and join them up. It's a single colored block of gray,
there's no difference at all. This isn't any kind of magic trick. It's the same shade of gray, but take it away again,
and it looks different. So what's happening here is that the brain
is using its prior expectations built deeply into the circuits
of the visual cortex that a cast shadow dims
the appearance of a surface, so that we see B as lighter
than it really is. Here's one more example, which shows just how quickly
the brain can use new predictions to change what we consciously experience. Have a listen to this. (Distorted voice) Sounded strange, right? Have a listen again
and see if you can get anything. (Distorted voice) Still strange. Now listen to this. (Recording) Anil Seth: I think Brexit
is a really terrible idea. (Laughter) Which I do. So you heard some words there, right? Now listen to the first sound again.
I'm just going to replay it. (Distorted voice) Yeah? So you can now hear words there. Once more for luck. (Distorted voice) OK, so what's going on here? The remarkable thing is the sensory
information coming into the brain hasn't changed at all. All that's changed
is your brain's best guess of the causes of that sensory information. And that changes
what you consciously hear. All this puts the brain
basis of perception in a bit of a different light. Instead of perception depending largely
on signals coming into the brain from the outside world, it depends as much, if not more, on perceptual predictions
flowing in the opposite direction. We don't just passively
perceive the world, we actively generate it. The world we experience
comes as much, if not more, from the inside out as from the outside in. Let me give you
one more example of perception as this active, constructive process. Here we've combined immersive
virtual reality with image processing to simulate the effects
of overly strong perceptual predictions on experience. In this panoramic video,
we've transformed the world -- which is in this case Sussex campus -- into a psychedelic playground. We've processed the footage using
an algorithm based on Google's Deep Dream to simulate the effects
of overly strong perceptual predictions. In this case, to see dogs. And you can see
this is a very strange thing. When perceptual
predictions are too strong, as they are here, the result looks very much
like the kinds of hallucinations people might report in altered states, or perhaps even in psychosis. Now, think about this for a minute. If hallucination is a kind
of uncontrolled perception, then perception right here and right now
is also a kind of hallucination, but a controlled hallucination in which the brain's predictions
are being reined in by sensory information from the world. In fact, we're all
hallucinating all the time, including right now. It's just that when we agree
about our hallucinations, we call that reality. (Laughter) Now I'm going to tell you
that your experience of being a self, the specific experience of being you, is also a controlled hallucination
generated by the brain. This seems a very strange idea, right? Yes, visual illusions
might deceive my eyes, but how could I be deceived
about what it means to be me? For most of us, the experience of being a person is so familiar, so unified
and so continuous that it's difficult
not to take it for granted. But we shouldn't take it for granted. There are in fact many different ways
we experience being a self. There's the experience of having a body and of being a body. There are experiences
of perceiving the world from a first person point of view. There are experiences
of intending to do things and of being the cause of things
that happen in the world. And there are experiences of being a continuous
and distinctive person over time, built from a rich set
of memories and social interactions. Many experiments show, and psychiatrists
and neurologists know very well, that these different ways
in which we experience being a self can all come apart. What this means is
the basic background experience of being a unified self is a rather
fragile construction of the brain. Another experience,
which just like all others, requires explanation. So let's return to the bodily self. How does the brain generate
the experience of being a body and of having a body? Well, just the same principles apply. The brain makes its best guess about what is and what is not
part of its body. And there's a beautiful experiment
in neuroscience to illustrate this. And unlike most neuroscience experiments, this is one you can do at home. All you need is one of these. (Laughter) And a couple of paintbrushes. In the rubber hand illusion, a person's real hand is hidden from view, and that fake rubber hand
is placed in front of them. Then both hands are simultaneously
stroked with a paintbrush while the person stares at the fake hand. Now, for most people, after a while, this leads to the very uncanny sensation that the fake hand
is in fact part of their body. And the idea is that the congruence
between seeing touch and feeling touch on an object that looks like hand
and is roughly where a hand should be, is enough evidence for the brain
to make its best guess that the fake hand
is in fact part of the body. (Laughter) So you can measure
all kinds of clever things. You can measure skin conductance
and startle responses, but there's no need. It's clear the guy in blue
has assimilated the fake hand. This means that even experiences
of what our body is is a kind of best guessing -- a kind of controlled
hallucination by the brain. There's one more thing. We don't just experience our bodies
as objects in the world from the outside, we also experience them from within. We all experience the sense
of being a body from the inside. And sensory signals
coming from the inside of the body are continually telling the brain
about the state of the internal organs, how the heart is doing,
what the blood pressure is like, lots of things. This kind of perception,
which we call interoception, is rather overlooked. But it's critically important because perception and regulation
of the internal state of the body -- well, that's what keeps us alive. Here's another version
of the rubber hand illusion. This is from our lab at Sussex. And here, people see
a virtual reality version of their hand, which flashes red and back either in time or out of time
with their heartbeat. And when it's flashing
in time with their heartbeat, people have a stronger sense
that it's in fact part of their body. So experiences of having a body
are deeply grounded in perceiving our bodies from within. There's one last thing
I want to draw your attention to, which is that experiences of the body
from the inside are very different from experiences of the world around us. When I look around me,
the world seems full of objects -- tables, chairs, rubber hands, people, you lot -- even my own body in the world, I can perceive it
as an object from the outside. But my experiences
of the body from within, they're not like that at all. I don't perceive my kidneys here, my liver here, my spleen ... I don't know where my spleen is, but it's somewhere. I don't perceive my insides as objects. In fact, I don't experience them
much at all unless they go wrong. And this is important, I think. Perception of the internal
state of the body isn't about figuring out what's there, it's about control and regulation -- keeping the physiological variables
within the tight bounds that are compatible with survival. When the brain uses predictions
to figure out what's there, we perceive objects
as the causes of sensations. When the brain uses predictions
to control and regulate things, we experience how well
or how badly that control is going. So our most basic experiences
of being a self, of being an embodied organism, are deeply grounded in the biological
mechanisms that keep us alive. And when we follow this idea
all the way through, we can start to see
that all of our conscious experiences, since they all depend on the same
mechanisms of predictive perception, all stem from this basic
drive to stay alive. We experience the world and ourselves with, through and because of
our living bodies. Let me bring things together step-by-step. What we consciously see depends on the brain's best guess
of what's out there. Our experienced world
comes from the inside out, not just the outside in. The rubber hand illusion shows
that this applies to our experiences of what is and what is not our body. And these self-related predictions
depend critically on sensory signals coming from deep inside the body. And finally, experiences of being an embodied self
are more about control and regulation than figuring out what's there. So our experiences of the world
around us and ourselves within it -- well, they're kinds
of controlled hallucinations that have been shaped
over millions of years of evolution to keep us alive in worlds
full of danger and opportunity. We predict ourselves into existence. Now, I leave you with three
implications of all this. First, just as we can
misperceive the world, we can misperceive ourselves when the mechanisms
of prediction go wrong. Understanding this opens many new
opportunities in psychiatry and neurology, because we can finally
get at the mechanisms rather than just treating the symptoms in conditions like
depression and schizophrenia. Second: what it means to be me
cannot be reduced to or uploaded to a software program running on a robot, however smart or sophisticated. We are biological, flesh-and-blood animals whose conscious experiences
are shaped at all levels by the biological mechanisms
that keep us alive. Just making computers smarter
is not going to make them sentient. Finally, our own individual inner universe, our way of being conscious, is just one possible
way of being conscious. And even human consciousness generally -- it's just a tiny region in a vast space
of possible consciousnesses. Our individual self and worlds
are unique to each of us, but they're all grounded
in biological mechanisms shared with many other living creatures. Now, these are fundamental changes in how we understand ourselves, but I think they should be celebrated, because as so often in science,
from Copernicus -- we're not at the center of the universe -- to Darwin -- we're related to all other creatures -- to the present day. With a greater sense of understanding comes a greater sense of wonder, and a greater realization that we are part of
and not apart from the rest of nature. And ... when the end of consciousness comes, there's nothing to be afraid of. Nothing at all. Thank you. (Applause)",2017-07-18T17:56:46Z
Why you should define your fears instead of your goals,Tim Ferriss,4455030,147585,1739,"The hard choices -- what we most fear doing, asking, saying -- are very often exactly what we need to do. How can we overcome ...","So, this happy pic of me
was taken in 1999. I was a senior in college, and it was right after a dance practice. I was really, really happy. And I remember exactly where I was
about a week and a half later. I was sitting in the back
of my used minivan in a campus parking lot, when I decided I was going to commit suicide. I went from deciding
to full-blown planning very quickly. And I came this close
to the edge of the precipice. It's the closest I've ever come. And the only reason I took
my finger off the trigger was thanks to a few lucky coincidences. And after the fact, that's what scared me the most:
the element of chance. So I became very methodical
about testing different ways that I could manage my ups and downs, which has proven to be
a good investment. (Laughs) Many normal people might have,
say, six to 10 major depressive episodes in their lives. I have bipolar depression.
It runs in my family. I've had 50-plus at this point, and I've learned a lot. I've had a lot of at-bats, many rounds in the ring with darkness, taking good notes. So I thought rather than get up
and give any type of recipe for success or highlight reel, I would share my recipe
for avoiding self-destruction, and certainly self-paralysis. And the tool I've found which has proven
to be the most reliable safety net for emotional free fall is actually the same tool that has helped me to make
my best business decisions. But that is secondary. And it is ... stoicism. That sounds boring. (Laughter) You might think of Spock, or it might conjure and image like this -- (Laughter) a cow standing in the rain. It's not sad. It's not particularly happy. It's just an impassive creature taking
whatever life sends its way. You might not think of the ultimate
competitor, say, Bill Belichick, head coach of the New England Patriots, who has the all-time NFL record
for Super Bowl titles. And stoicism has spread like wildfire
in the top of the NFL ranks as a means of mental toughness
training in the last few years. You might not think
of the Founding Fathers -- Thomas Jefferson, John Adams,
George Washington to name but three students of stoicism. George Washington actually had
a play about a Stoic -- this was ""Cato, a Tragedy"" -- performed for his troops at Valley Forge
to keep them motivated. So why would people of action
focus so much on an ancient philosophy? This seems very academic. I would encourage you to think
about stoicism a little bit differently, as an operating system for thriving
in high-stress environments, for making better decisions. And it all started here, kind of, on a porch. So around 300 BC in Athens, someone named Zeno of Citium
taught many lectures walking around a painted porch, a ""stoa."" That later became ""stoicism."" And in the Greco-Roman world, people used stoicism
as a comprehensive system for doing many, many things. But for our purposes, chief among them
was training yourself to separate what you can control
from what you cannot control, and then doing exercises
to focus exclusively on the former. This decreases emotional reactivity, which can be a superpower. Conversely, let's say
you're a quarterback. You miss a pass.
You get furious with yourself. That could cost you a game. If you're a CEO, and you fly
off the handle at a very valued employee because of a minor infraction, that could cost you the employee. If you're a college student
who, say, is in a downward spiral, and you feel helpless and hopeless, unabated, that could cost you your life. So the stakes are very, very high. And there are many tools
in the toolkit to get you there. I'm going to focus on one
that completely changed my life in 2004. It found me then because of two things: a very close friend, young guy, my age,
died of pancreatic cancer unexpectedly, and then my girlfriend, who I thought
I was going to marry, walked out. She'd had enough, and she didn't
give me a Dear John letter, but she did give me this, a Dear John plaque. (Laughter) I'm not making this up. I've kept it. ""Business hours are over at five o'clock."" She gave this to me
to put on my desk for personal health, because at the time, I was working
on my first real business. I had no idea what I was doing.
I was working 14-plus hour days, seven days a week. I was using stimulants to get going. I was using depressants
to wind down and go to sleep. It was a disaster. I felt completely trapped. I bought a book on simplicity
to try to find answers. And I did find a quote
that made a big difference in my life, which was, ""We suffer more often
in imagination than in reality,"" by Seneca the Younger, who was a famous Stoic writer. That took me to his letters, which took me to the exercise, ""premeditatio malorum,"" which means the pre-meditation of evils. In simple terms, this is visualizing the worst-case
scenarios, in detail, that you fear, preventing you from taking action, so that you can take action
to overcome that paralysis. My problem was monkey mind --
super loud, very incessant. Just thinking my way
through problems doesn't work. I needed to capture my thoughts on paper. So I created a written exercise that I called ""fear-setting,""
like goal-setting, for myself. It consists of three pages. Super simple. The first page is right here. ""What if I ...?"" This is whatever you fear, whatever is causing you anxiety, whatever you're putting off. It could be asking someone out, ending a relationship, asking for a promotion,
quitting a job, starting a company. It could be anything. For me, it was taking
my first vacation in four years and stepping away from my business
for a month to go to London, where I could stay
in a friend's room for free, to either remove myself
as a bottleneck in the business or shut it down. In the first column, ""Define,"" you're writing down all of the worst
things you can imagine happening if you take that step. You want 10 to 20. I won't go through all of them,
but I'll give you two examples. One was, I'll go to London,
it'll be rainy, I'll get depressed, the whole thing will be
a huge waste of time. Number two, I'll miss
a letter from the IRS, and I'll get audited or raided or shut down or some such. And then you go to the ""Prevent"" column. In that column, you write
down the answer to: What could I do to prevent
each of these bullets from happening, or, at the very least, decrease
the likelihood even a little bit? So for getting depressed in London, I could take a portable blue light with me and use it for 15 minutes in the morning. I knew that helped stave off
depressive episodes. For the IRS bit, I could change
the mailing address on file with the IRS so the paperwork would go to my accountant instead of to my UPS address. Easy-peasy. Then we go to ""Repair."" So if the worst-case scenarios happen, what could you do to repair
the damage even a little bit, or who could you ask for help? So in the first case, London, well, I could fork over some money,
fly to Spain, get some sun -- undo the damage, if I got into a funk. In the case of missing
a letter from the IRS, I could call a friend who is a lawyer or ask, say, a professor of law what they would recommend, who I should talk to,
how had people handled this in the past. So one question to keep in mind
as you're doing this first page is: Has anyone else in the history of time less intelligent or less driven figured this out? Chances are, the answer is ""Yes."" (Laughter) The second page is simple: What might be the benefits
of an attempt or a partial success? You can see we're playing up the fears and really taking a conservative
look at the upside. So if you attempted whatever
you're considering, might you build confidence,
develop skills, emotionally, financially, otherwise? What might be the benefits
of, say, a base hit? Spend 10 to 15 minutes on this. Page three. This might be the most important,
so don't skip it: ""The Cost of Inaction."" Humans are very good at considering
what might go wrong if we try something new,
say, ask for a raise. What we don't often consider
is the atrocious cost of the status quo -- not changing anything. So you should ask yourself, if I avoid this action or decision and actions and decisions like it, what might my life look like in,
say, six months, 12 months, three years? Any further out, it starts
to seem intangible. And really get detailed --
again, emotionally, financially, physically, whatever. And when I did this, it painted
a terrifying picture. I was self-medicating, my business was going to implode
at any moment at all times, if I didn't step away. My relationships were fraying or failing. And I realized that inaction
was no longer an option for me. Those are the three pages. That's it.
That's fear-setting. And after this, I realized
that on a scale of one to 10, one being minimal impact,
10 being maximal impact, if I took the trip, I was risking a one to three of temporary
and reversible pain for an eight to 10 of positive,
life-changing impact that could be a semi-permanent. So I took the trip. None of the disasters came to pass. There were some hiccups, sure. I was able to extricate myself
from the business. I ended up extending that trip
for a year and a half around the world, and that became the basis
for my first book, that leads me here today. And I can trace all of my biggest wins and all of my biggest disasters averted back to doing fear-setting at least once a quarter. It's not a panacea. You'll find that some of your fears
are very well-founded. (Laughter) But you shouldn't conclude that without first putting them
under a microscope. And it doesn't make all the hard times,
the hard choices, easy, but it can make a lot of them easier. I'd like to close with a profile
of one of my favorite modern-day Stoics. This is Jerzy Gregorek. He is a four-time world champion
in Olympic weightlifting, political refugee, published poet, 62 years old. He can still kick my ass and probably
most asses in this room. He's an impressive guy. I spent a lot of time
on his stoa, his porch, asking life and training advice. He was part of the Solidarity in Poland, which was a nonviolent
movement for social change that was violently suppressed
by the government. He lost his career as a firefighter. Then his mentor, a priest,
was kidnapped, tortured, killed and thrown into a river. He was then threatened. He and his wife had to flee Poland,
bounce from country to country until they landed in the US
with next to nothing, sleeping on floors. He now lives in Woodside, California,
in a very nice place, and of the 10,000-plus people
I've met in my life, I would put him in the top 10, in terms of success and happiness. And there's a punchline coming,
so pay attention. I sent him a text a few weeks ago, asking him: Had he ever read
any Stoic philosophy? And he replied with two pages of text. This is very unlike him.
He is a terse dude. (Laughter) And not only was he familiar
with stoicism, but he pointed out, for all
of his most important decisions, his inflection points, when he stood up
for his principles and ethics, how he had used stoicism
and something akin to fear-setting, which blew my mind. And he closed with two things. Number one: he couldn't imagine
any life more beautiful than that of a Stoic. And the last was his mantra,
which he applies to everything, and you can apply to everything: ""Easy choices, hard life. Hard choices, easy life."" The hard choices -- what we most fear doing, asking, saying -- these are very often exactly
what we most need to do. And the biggest challenges
and problems we face will never be solved
with comfortable conversations, whether it's in your own head
or with other people. So I encourage you to ask yourselves: Where in your lives right now might defining your fears be more
important than defining your goals? Keeping in mind all the while,
the words of Seneca: ""We suffer more often
in imagination than in reality."" Thank you very much. (Applause)",2017-07-14T15:01:35Z

How to gain control of your free time,Laura Vanderkam,9264048,211738,2563,There are 168 hours in each week. How do we find time for what matters most? Time management expert Laura Vanderkam ...,"Translator: Leslie Gauthier
Reviewer: Camille Martínez When people find out
I write about time management, they assume two things. One is that I'm always on time, and I'm not. I have four small children, and I would like to blame them
for my occasional tardiness, but sometimes it's just not their fault. I was once late to my own speech
on time management. (Laughter) We all had to just take a moment
together and savor that irony. The second thing they assume
is that I have lots of tips and tricks for saving bits of time here and there. Sometimes I'll hear from magazines
that are doing a story along these lines, generally on how to help their readers
find an extra hour in the day. And the idea is that we'll shave
bits of time off everyday activities, add it up, and we'll have time for the good stuff. I question the entire premise
of this piece, but I'm always interested in hearing what they've come
up with before they call me. Some of my favorites: doing errands where you only
have to make right-hand turns -- (Laughter) Being extremely judicious
in microwave usage: it says three to three-and-a-half
minutes on the package, we're totally getting in on
the bottom side of that. And my personal favorite,
which makes sense on some level, is to DVR your favorite shows so you can
fast-forward through the commercials. That way, you save
eight minutes every half hour, so in the course of two hours
of watching TV, you find 32 minutes to exercise. (Laughter) Which is true. You know another way to find
32 minutes to exercise? Don't watch two hours of TV a day, right? (Laughter) Anyway, the idea is we'll save bits
of time here and there, add it up, we will finally get
to everything we want to do. But after studying how successful
people spend their time and looking at their
schedules hour by hour, I think this idea
has it completely backward. We don't build the lives
we want by saving time. We build the lives we want, and then time saves itself. Here's what I mean. I recently did a time diary project looking at 1,001 days in the lives
of extremely busy women. They had demanding jobs,
sometimes their own businesses, kids to care for,
maybe parents to care for, community commitments -- busy, busy people. I had them keep track
of their time for a week so I could add up how much
they worked and slept, and I interviewed them
about their strategies, for my book. One of the women whose time log I studied goes out on a Wednesday night
for something. She comes home to find
that her water heater has broken, and there is now water
all over her basement. If you've ever had anything
like this happen to you, you know it is a hugely damaging,
frightening, sopping mess. So she's dealing with the immediate
aftermath that night, next day she's got plumbers coming in, day after that, professional cleaning
crew dealing with the ruined carpet. All this is being recorded
on her time log. Winds up taking seven hours of her week. Seven hours. That's like finding
an extra hour in the day. But I'm sure if you had asked her
at the start of the week, ""Could you find seven hours
to train for a triathlon?"" ""Could you find seven hours
to mentor seven worthy people?"" I'm sure she would've said
what most of us would've said, which is, ""No -- can't you see
how busy I am?"" Yet when she had to find seven hours because there is water
all over her basement, she found seven hours. And what this shows us
is that time is highly elastic. We cannot make more time, but time will stretch to accommodate
what we choose to put into it. And so the key to time management is treating our priorities as the equivalent
of that broken water heater. To get at this, I like to use language from one
of the busiest people I ever interviewed. By busy, I mean she was running
a small business with 12 people on the payroll, she had six children in her spare time. I was getting in touch with her
to set up an interview on how she ""had it all"" -- that phrase. I remember it was a Thursday morning, and she was not available
to speak with me. Of course, right? But the reason she was
unavailable to speak with me is that she was out for a hike, because it was a beautiful spring morning, and she wanted to go for a hike. So of course this makes me
even more intrigued, and when I finally do catch up with her,
she explains it like this. She says, ""Listen Laura, everything I do, every minute I spend, is my choice."" And rather than say, ""I don't have time to do x, y or z,"" she'd say, ""I don't do x, y or z
because it's not a priority."" ""I don't have time,"" often means
""It's not a priority."" If you think about it,
that's really more accurate language. I could tell you I don't have time
to dust my blinds, but that's not true. If you offered to pay me $100,000
to dust my blinds, I would get to it pretty quickly. (Laughter) Since that is not going to happen, I can acknowledge this is not
a matter of lacking time; it's that I don't want to do it. Using this language reminds us
that time is a choice. And granted, there may be horrible consequences
for making different choices, I will give you that. But we are smart people, and certainly over the long run, we have the power to fill our lives with the things that deserve to be there. So how do we do that? How do we treat our priorities as the equivalent
of that broken water heater? Well, first we need
to figure out what they are. I want to give you two strategies
for thinking about this. The first, on the professional side: I'm sure many people
coming up to the end of the year are giving or getting
annual performance reviews. You look back over
your successes over the year, your ""opportunities for growth."" And this serves its purpose, but I find it's more effective
to do this looking forward. So I want you to pretend
it's the end of next year. You're giving yourself
a performance review, and it has been an absolutely
amazing year for you professionally. What three to five things did you do
that made it so amazing? So you can write next
year's performance review now. And you can do this
for your personal life, too. I'm sure many of you,
like me, come December, get cards that contain these folded up
sheets of colored paper, on which is written what is known
as the family holiday letter. (Laughter) Bit of a wretched genre
of literature, really, going on about how amazing
everyone in the household is, or even more scintillating, how busy everyone in the household is. But these letters serve a purpose, which is that they tell
your friends and family what you did in your personal life
that mattered to you over the year. So this year's kind of done, but I want you to pretend
it's the end of next year, and it has been an absolutely amazing year for you and the people you care about. What three to five things did you do
that made it so amazing? So you can write next
year's family holiday letter now. Don't send it. (Laughter) Please, don't send it. But you can write it. And now, between the performance
review and the family holiday letter, we have a list of six to ten goals
we can work on in the next year. And now we need to break
these down into doable steps. So maybe you want
to write a family history. First, you can read
some other family histories, get a sense for the style. Then maybe think about the questions
you want to ask your relatives, set up appointments to interview them. Or maybe you want to run a 5K. So you need to find a race and sign up,
figure out a training plan, and dig those shoes
out of the back of the closet. And then -- this is key -- we treat our priorities as the equivalent
of that broken water heater, by putting them into our schedules first. We do this by thinking through our weeks
before we are in them. I find a really good time to do this
is Friday afternoons. Friday afternoon is what
an economist might call a ""low opportunity cost"" time. Most of us are not sitting there
on Friday afternoons saying, ""I am excited to make progress toward my personal
and professional priorities right now."" (Laughter) But we are willing to think
about what those should be. So take a little bit
of time Friday afternoon, make yourself a three-category priority
list: career, relationships, self. Making a three-category list reminds us that there should be something
in all three categories. Career, we think about; relationships, self -- not so much. But anyway, just a short list, two to three items in each. Then look out over the whole
of the next week, and see where you can plan them in. Where you plan them in is up to you. I know this is going to be more
complicated for some people than others. I mean, some people's lives
are just harder than others. It is not going to be easy
to find time to take that poetry class if you are caring for multiple
children on your own. I get that. And I don't want to minimize
anyone's struggle. But I do think that the numbers
I am about to tell you are empowering. There are 168 hours in a week. Twenty-four times seven is 168 hours. That is a lot of time. If you are working a full-time
job, so 40 hours a week, sleeping eight hours a night,
so 56 hours a week -- that leaves 72 hours for other things. That is a lot of time. You say you're working 50 hours a week, maybe a main job and a side hustle. Well, that leaves 62 hours
for other things. You say you're working 60 hours. Well, that leaves 52 hours
for other things. You say you're working more than 60 hours. Well, are you sure? (Laughter) There was once a study comparing
people's estimated work weeks with time diaries. They found that people claiming
75-plus-hour work weeks were off by about 25 hours. (Laughter) You can guess in which direction, right? Anyway, in 168 hours a week, I think we can find time
for what matters to you. If you want to spend
more time with your kids, you want to study more
for a test you're taking, you want to exercise for three hours
and volunteer for two, you can. And that's even if you're working
way more than full-time hours. So we have plenty of time, which is great, because guess what? We don't even need that much
time to do amazing things. But when most of us have
bits of time, what do we do? Pull out the phone, right? Start deleting emails. Otherwise, we're puttering
around the house or watching TV. But small moments can have great power. You can use your bits of time for bits of joy. Maybe it's choosing to read
something wonderful on the bus on the way to work. I know when I had a job
that required two bus rides and a subway ride every morning, I used to go to the library
on weekends to get stuff to read. It made the whole experience
almost, almost, enjoyable. Breaks at work can be used
for meditating or praying. If family dinner is out
because of your crazy work schedule, maybe family breakfast
could be a good substitute. It's about looking at
the whole of one's time and seeing where the good stuff can go. I truly believe this. There is time. Even if we are busy, we have time for what matters. And when we focus on what matters, we can build the lives we want in the time we've got. Thank you. (Applause)",2017-02-07T16:21:14Z
What I learned from 100 days of rejection,Jia Jiang,6379559,271717,5319,Jia Jiang adventures boldly into a territory so many of us fear: rejection. By seeking out rejection for 100 days -- from asking a ...,"When I was six years old, I received my gifts. My first grade teacher
had this brilliant idea. She wanted us to experience
receiving gifts but also learning the virtue
of complimenting each other. So she had all of us
come to the front of the classroom, and she bought all of us gifts
and stacked them in the corner. And she said, ""Why don't we just stand here
and compliment each other? If you hear your name called, go and pick up your gift and sit down."" What a wonderful idea, right? What could go wrong? (Laughter) Well, there were 40 of us to start with, and every time I heard
someone's name called, I would give out the heartiest cheer. And then there were 20 people left, and 10 people left, and five left ... and three left. And I was one of them. And the compliments stopped. Well, at that moment, I was crying. And the teacher was freaking out. She was like, ""Hey, would anyone
say anything nice about these people?"" (Laughter) ""No one? OK, why don't you
go get your gift and sit down. So behave next year -- someone might say
something nice about you."" (Laughter) Well, as I'm describing this you, you probably know
I remember this really well. (Laughter) But I don't know who felt worse that day. Was it me or the teacher? She must have realized
that she turned a team-building event into a public roast
for three six-year-olds. And without the humor. You know, when you see
people get roasted on TV, it was funny. There was nothing funny about that day. So that was one version of me, and I would die to avoid
being in that situation again -- to get rejected in public again. That's one version. Then fast-forward eight years. Bill Gates came to my hometown -- Beijing, China -- to speak, and I saw his message. I fell in love with that guy. I thought, wow,
I know what I want to do now. That night I wrote a letter to my family telling them: ""By age 25, I will build the biggest
company in the world, and that company will buy Microsoft."" (Laughter) I totally embraced this idea
of conquering the world -- domination, right? And I didn't make this up,
I did write that letter. And here it is -- (Laughter) You don't have to read this through -- (Laughter) This is also bad handwriting,
but I did highlight some key words. You get the idea. (Laughter) So ... that was another version of me: one who will conquer the world. Well, then two years later, I was presented with the opportunity
to come to the United States. I jumped on it, because that was
where Bill Gates lived, right? (Laughter) I thought that was the start
of my entrepreneur journey. Then, fast-forward another 14 years. I was 30. Nope, I didn't build that company. I didn't even start. I was actually a marketing manager
for a Fortune 500 company. And I felt I was stuck; I was stagnant. Why is that? Where is that 14-year-old
who wrote that letter? It's not because he didn't try. It's because every time I had a new idea, every time I wanted to try something new, even at work -- I wanted to make a proposal, I wanted to speak up
in front of people in a group -- I felt there was this constant battle between the 14-year-old
and the six-year-old. One wanted to conquer the world -- make a difference -- another was afraid of rejection. And every time that six-year-old won. And this fear even persisted
after I started my own company. I mean, I started
my own company when I was 30 -- if you want to be Bill Gates, you've got to start
sooner or later, right? When I was an entrepreneur, I was presented
with an investment opportunity, and then I was turned down. And that rejection hurt me. It hurt me so bad
that I wanted to quit right there. But then I thought, hey, would Bill Gates quit
after a simple investment rejection? Would any successful
entrepreneur quit like that? No way. And this is where it clicked for me. OK, I can build a better company. I can build a better
team or better product, but one thing for sure: I've got to be a better leader. I've got to be a better person. I cannot let that six-year-old
keep dictating my life anymore. I have to put him back in his place. So this is where I went online
and looked for help. Google was my friend. (Laughter) I searched, ""How do I overcome
the fear of rejection?"" I came up with a bunch
of psychology articles about where the fear
and pain are coming from. Then I came up with a bunch
of ""rah-rah"" inspirational articles about ""Don't take it personally,
just overcome it."" Who doesn't know that? (Laughter) But why was I still so scared? Then I found this website by luck. It's called rejectiontherapy.com. (Laughter) ""Rejection Therapy"" was this game
invented by this Canadian entrepreneur. His name is Jason Comely. And basically the idea is for 30 days
you go out and look for rejection, and every day get rejected at something, and then by the end,
you desensitize yourself from the pain. And I loved that idea. (Laughter) I said, ""You know what?
I'm going to do this. And I'll feel myself
getting rejected 100 days."" And I came up with my own rejection ideas, and I made a video blog out of it. And so here's what I did. This is what the blog looked like. Day One ... (Laughter) Borrow 100 dollars from a stranger. So this is where I went
to where I was working. I came downstairs and I saw this big guy
sitting behind a desk. He looked like a security guard. So I just approached him. And I was just walking and that was the longest
walk of my life -- hair on the back
of my neck standing up, I was sweating and my heart was pounding. And I got there and said, ""Hey, sir, can I borrow
100 dollars from you?"" (Laughter) And he looked up, he's like, ""No."" ""Why?"" And I just said, ""No? I'm sorry."" Then I turned around,
and I just ran. (Laughter) I felt so embarrassed. But because I filmed myself -- so that night I was watching
myself getting rejected, I just saw how scared I was. I looked like this kid
in ""The Sixth Sense."" I saw dead people. (Laughter) But then I saw this guy. You know, he wasn't that menacing. He was a chubby, loveable guy, and he even asked me, ""Why?"" In fact, he invited me to explain myself. And I could've said many things. I could've explained,
I could've negotiated. I didn't do any of that. All I did was run. I felt, wow, this is like
a microcosm of my life. Every time I felt the slightest rejection, I would just run as fast as I could. And you know what? The next day, no matter what happens, I'm not going to run. I'll stay engaged. Day Two: Request a ""burger refill."" (Laughter) It's when I went to a burger joint, I finished lunch,
and I went to the cashier and said, ""Hi, can I get a burger refill?"" (Laughter) He was all confused,
like, ""What's a burger refill?"" (Laughter) I said, ""Well, it's just like
a drink refill but with a burger."" And he said, ""Sorry,
we don't do burger refill, man."" (Laughter) So this is where rejection happened
and I could have run, but I stayed. I said, ""Well, I love your burgers, I love your joint, and if you guys do a burger refill, I will love you guys more."" (Laughter) And he said, ""Well, OK,
I'll tell my manager about it, and maybe we'll do it,
but sorry, we can't do this today."" Then I left. And by the way, I don't think they've
ever done burger refill. (Laughter) I think they're still there. But the life and death feeling
I was feeling the first time was no longer there, just because I stayed engaged -- because I didn't run. I said, ""Wow, great,
I'm already learning things. Great."" And then Day Three:
Getting Olympic Doughnuts. This is where my life
was turned upside down. I went to a Krispy Kreme. It's a doughnut shop in mainly the Southeastern part
of the United States. I'm sure they have some here, too. And I went in, I said, ""Can you make me doughnuts
that look like Olympic symbols? Basically, you interlink
five doughnuts together ... "" I mean there's no way
they could say yes, right? The doughnut maker took me so seriously. (Laughter) So she put out paper, started jotting down
the colors and the rings, and is like, ""How can I make this?"" And then 15 minutes later, she came out with a box
that looked like Olympic rings. And I was so touched. I just couldn't believe it. And that video got
over five million views on Youtube. The world couldn't believe that either. (Laughter) You know, because of that
I was in newspapers, in talk shows, in everything. And I became famous. A lot of people
started writing emails to me and saying, ""What you're
doing is awesome."" But you know, fame and notoriety
did not do anything to me. What I really wanted to do was learn, and to change myself. So I turned the rest
of my 100 days of rejection into this playground -- into this research project. I wanted to see what I could learn. And then I learned a lot of things. I discovered so many secrets. For example, I found if I just don't run, if I got rejected, I could actually turn a ""no"" into a ""yes,"" and the magic word is, ""why."" So one day I went to a stranger's house,
I had this flower in my hand, knocked on the door and said, ""Hey, can I plant this flower
in your backyard?"" (Laughter) And he said, ""No."" But before he could leave I said, ""Hey, can I know why?"" And he said, ""Well, I have this dog that would dig up
anything I put in the backyard. I don't want to waste your flower. If you want to do this,
go across the street and talk to Connie. She loves flowers."" So that's what I did. I went across and knocked
on Connie's door. And she was so happy to see me. (Laughter) And then half an hour later, there was this flower
in Connie's backyard. I'm sure it looks better now. (Laughter) But had I left
after the initial rejection, I would've thought, well, it's because
the guy didn't trust me, it's because I was crazy, because I didn't dress up well,
I didn't look good. It was none of those. It was because what I offered
did not fit what he wanted. And he trusted me enough
to offer me a referral, using a sales term. I converted a referral. Then one day -- and I also learned that I can
actually say certain things and maximize my chance to get a yes. So for example,
one day I went to a Starbucks, and asked the manager,
""Hey, can I be a Starbucks greeter?"" He was like, ""What's a Starbucks greeter?"" I said, ""Do you know
those Walmart greeters? You know, those people who say
'hi' to you before you walk in the store, and make sure you
don't steal stuff, basically? I want to give a Walmart experience
to Starbucks customers."" (Laughter) Well, I'm not sure
that's a good thing, actually -- Actually, I'm pretty sure
it's a bad thing. And he was like, ""Oh"" -- yeah, this is how he looked,
his name is Eric -- and he was like, ""I'm not sure."" This is how he was hearing me. ""Not sure."" Then I ask him, ""Is that weird?"" He's like, ""Yeah, it's really weird, man."" But as soon as he said that,
his whole demeanor changed. It's as if he's putting
all the doubt on the floor. And he said, ""Yeah, you can do this, just don't get too weird."" (Laughter) So for the next hour
I was the Starbucks greeter. I said ""hi"" to every customer
that walked in, and gave them holiday cheers. By the way, I don't know
what your career trajectory is, don't be a greeter. (Laughter) It was really boring. But then I found I could do this
because I mentioned, ""Is that weird?"" I mentioned the doubt that he was having. And because I mentioned, ""Is that weird?"",
that means I wasn't weird. That means I was actually
thinking just like him, seeing this as a weird thing. And again, and again, I learned that if I mention
some doubt people might have before I ask the question, I gained their trust. People were more likely to say yes to me. And then I learned
I could fulfill my life dream ... by asking. You know, I came
from four generations of teachers, and my grandma has always told me, ""Hey Jia, you can do anything you want, but it'd be great
if you became a teacher."" (Laughter) But I wanted to be
an entrepreneur, so I didn't. But it has always been my dream
to actually teach something. So I said, ""What if I just ask and teach a college class?"" I lived in Austin at the time, so I went to University
of Texas at Austin and knocked on professors' doors
and said, ""Can I teach your class?"" I didn't get anywhere
the first couple of times. But because I didn't run --
I kept doing it -- and on the third try
the professor was very impressed. He was like, ""No one
has done this before."" And I came in prepared
with powerpoints and my lesson. He said, ""Wow, I can use this. Why don't you come back in two months?
I'll fit you in my curriculum."" And two months later
I was teaching a class. This is me -- you probably can't see,
this is a bad picture. You know, sometimes you get
rejected by lighting, you know? (Laughter) But wow -- when I finished teaching that class,
I walked out crying, because I thought I could fulfill my life dream
just by simply asking. I used to think I have to accomplish
all these things -- have to be a great entrepreneur,
or get a PhD to teach -- but no, I just asked, and I could teach. And in that picture,
which you can't see, I quoted Martin Luther King, Jr. Why? Because in my research I found
that people who really change the world, who change the way we live
and the way we think, are the people who were met
with initial and often violent rejections. People like Martin Luther King, Jr., like Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, or even Jesus Christ. These people did not
let rejection define them. They let their own reaction
after rejection define themselves. And they embraced rejection. And we don't have to be those people
to learn about rejection, and in my case, rejection was my curse, was my boogeyman. It has bothered me my whole life
because I was running away from it. Then I started embracing it. I turned that into
the biggest gift in my life. I started teaching people
how to turn rejections into opportunities. I use my blog, I use my talk, I use the book I just published, and I'm even building technology to help
people overcome their fear of rejection. When you get rejected in life, when you are facing the next obstacle or next failure, consider the possibilities. Don't run. If you just embrace them, they might become your gifts as well. Thank you. (Applause)",2017-01-06T22:03:19Z
The urgency of intersectionality,Kimberlé Crenshaw,2012686,36171,0,"Now more than ever, it's important to look boldly at the reality of race and gender bias -- and understand how the two can combine ...","I'd like to try something new. Those of you who are able, please stand up. OK, so I'm going to name some names. When you hear a name
that you don't recognize, you can't tell me anything about them, I'd like you to take a seat and stay seated. The last person standing,
we're going to see what they know. OK? (Laughter) All right. Eric Garner. Mike Brown. Tamir Rice. Freddie Gray. So those of you who are still standing, I'd like you to turn around
and take a look. I'd say half to most of the people
are still standing. So let's continue. Michelle Cusseaux. Tanisha Anderson. Aura Rosser. Meagan Hockaday. So if we look around again, there are about four people
still standing, and actually I'm not going
to put you on the spot. I just say that to encourage transparency,
so you can be seated. (Laughter) So those of you who recognized
the first group of names know that these were African-Americans
who have been killed by the police over the last two and a half years. What you may not know is that the other list
is also African-Americans who have been killed
within the last two years. Only one thing distinguishes
the names that you know from the names that you don't know: gender. So let me first let you know
that there's nothing at all distinct about this audience that explains the pattern of recognition
that we've just seen. I've done this exercise
dozens of times around the country. I've done it to women's
rights organizations. I've done it with civil rights groups. I've done it with professors.
I've done it with students. I've done it with psychologists.
I've done it with sociologists. I've done it even with
progressive members of Congress. And everywhere, the awareness
of the level of police violence that black women experience is exceedingly low. Now, it is surprising, isn't it,
that this would be the case. I mean, there are two issues
involved here. There's police violence
against African-Americans, and there's violence against women, two issues that have been
talked about a lot lately. But when we think about
who is implicated by these problems, when we think about
who is victimized by these problems, the names of these black women
never come to mind. Now, communications experts tell us that when facts do not fit
with the available frames, people have a difficult time
incorporating new facts into their way of thinking
about a problem. These women's names
have slipped through our consciousness because there are no frames
for us to see them, no frames for us to remember them, no frames for us to hold them. As a consequence, reporters don't lead with them, policymakers don't think about them, and politicians aren't encouraged
or demanded that they speak to them. Now, you might ask, why does a frame matter? I mean, after all, an issue that affects black people
and an issue that affects women, wouldn't that necessarily include
black people who are women and women who are black people? Well, the simple answer is that this is
a trickle-down approach to social justice, and many times it just doesn't work. Without frames that allow us to see how social problems impact
all the members of a targeted group, many will fall through the cracks
of our movements, left to suffer in virtual isolation. But it doesn't have to be this way. Many years ago, I began to use
the term ""intersectionality"" to deal with the fact
that many of our social justice problems like racism and sexism are often overlapping, creating multiple levels
of social injustice. Now, the experience
that gave rise to intersectionality was my chance encounter
with a woman named Emma DeGraffenreid. Emma DeGraffenreid
was an African-American woman, a working wife and a mother. I actually read about Emma's story
from the pages of a legal opinion written by a judge
who had dismissed Emma's claim of race and gender discrimination against a local car manufacturing plant. Emma, like so many African-American women, sought better employment
for her family and for others. She wanted to create a better life
for her children and for her family. But she applied for a job, and she was not hired, and she believed that she was not hired
because she was a black woman. Now, the judge in question
dismissed Emma's suit, and the argument
for dismissing the suit was that the employer
did hire African-Americans and the employer hired women. The real problem, though, that the judge
was not willing to acknowledge was what Emma was actually trying to say, that the African-Americans
that were hired, usually for industrial jobs,
maintenance jobs, were all men. And the women that were hired, usually for secretarial
or front-office work, were all white. Only if the court was able to see
how these policies came together would he be able to see
the double discrimination that Emma DeGraffenreid was facing. But the court refused to allow Emma
to put two causes of action together to tell her story because he believed that,
by allowing her to do that, she would be able
to have preferential treatment. She would have an advantage
by having two swings at the bat, when African-American men and white women
only had one swing at the bat. But of course, neither
African-American men or white women needed to combine a race
and gender discrimination claim to tell the story of the discrimination
they were experiencing. Why wasn't the real unfairness law's refusal to protect
African-American women simply because their experiences
weren't exactly the same as white women and African-American men? Rather than broadening the frame
to include African-American women, the court simply tossed their case
completely out of court. Now, as a student
of antidiscrimination law, as a feminist, as an antiracist, I was struck by this case. It felt to me like injustice squared. So first of all, black women weren't allowed
to work at the plant. Second of all, the court
doubled down on this exclusion by making it legally inconsequential. And to boot, there was
no name for this problem. And we all know that,
where there's no name for a problem, you can't see a problem, and when you can't see a problem,
you pretty much can't solve it. Many years later, I had come to recognize that the problem that Emma was facing
was a framing problem. The frame that the court was using to see gender discrimination
or to see race discrimination was partial, and it was distorting. For me, the challenge that I faced was trying to figure out whether
there was an alternative narrative, a prism that would allow us
to see Emma's dilemma, a prism that would allow us
to rescue her from the cracks in the law, that would allow judges to see her story. So it occurred to me, maybe a simple analogy to an intersection might allow judges
to better see Emma's dilemma. So if we think about this intersection,
the roads to the intersection would be the way that the workforce
was structured by race and by gender. And then the traffic in those roads
would be the hiring policies and the other practices
that ran through those roads. Now, because Emma
was both black and female, she was positioned precisely
where those roads overlapped, experiencing the simultaneous impact of the company's gender and race traffic. The law -- the law is
like that ambulance that shows up and is ready to treat Emma
only if it can be shown that she was harmed
on the race road or on the gender road but not where those roads intersected. So what do you call
being impacted by multiple forces and then abandoned to fend for yourself? Intersectionality seemed to do it for me. I would go on to learn
that African-American women, like other women of color, like other socially marginalized people
all over the world, were facing all kinds
of dilemmas and challenges as a consequence of intersectionality, intersections of race and gender, of heterosexism, transphobia,
xenophobia, ableism, all of these social dynamics come together and create challenges
that are sometimes quite unique. But in the same way that intersectionality raised our awareness to the way
that black women live their lives, it also exposes the tragic circumstances under which African-American women die. Police violence against black women is very real. The level of violence
that black women face is such that it's not surprising that some of them do not survive
their encounters with police. Black girls as young as seven, great grandmothers as old as 95 have been killed by the police. They've been killed in their living rooms, in their bedrooms. They've been killed in their cars. They've been killed on the street. They've been killed
in front of their parents and they've been killed
in front of their children. They have been shot to death. They have been stomped to death. They have been suffocated to death. They have been manhandled to death. They have been tasered to death. They've been killed
when they've called for help. They've been killed when they were alone, and they've been killed
when they were with others. They've been killed shopping while black, driving while black, having a mental disability while black, having a domestic disturbance while black. They've even been killed
being homeless while black. They've been killed
talking on the cell phone, laughing with friends, sitting in a car reported as stolen and making a U-turn
in front of the White House with an infant strapped
in the backseat of the car. Why don't we know these stories? Why is it that their lost lives don't generate the same amount
of media attention and communal outcry as the lost lives
of their fallen brothers? It's time for a change. So what can we do? In 2014, the African-American
Policy Forum began to demand that we ""say her name"" at rallies, at protests, at conferences, at meetings, anywhere and everywhere that state violence against black bodies
is being discussed. But saying her name is not enough. We have to be willing to do more. We have to be willing to bear witness, to bear witness
to the often painful realities that we would just rather not confront, the everyday violence and humiliation
that many black women have had to face, black women across color, age, gender expression, sexuality and ability. So we have the opportunity right now -- bearing in mind that some of the images
that I'm about to share with you may be triggering for some -- to collectively bear witness
to some of this violence. We're going to hear the voice
of the phenomenal Abby Dobson. And as we sit with these women, some who have experienced violence
and some who have not survived them, we have an opportunity to reverse what happened
at the beginning of this talk, when we could not stand for these women because we did not know their names. So at the end of this clip,
there's going to be a roll call. Several black women's names will come up. I'd like those of you who are able
to join us in saying these names as loud as you can, randomly, disorderly. Let's create a cacophony of sound to represent our intention to hold these women up, to sit with them, to bear witness to them, to bring them into the light. (Singing) Abby Dobson: Say, say her name. Say, say her name. (Audience) Shelly! (Audience) Kayla! AD: Oh, say her name. (Audience shouting names) Say, say, say her name. Say her name. For all the names I'll never know, say her name. KC: Aiyanna Stanley Jones,
Janisha Fonville, Kathryn Johnston, Kayla Moore, Michelle Cusseaux, Rekia Boyd, Shelly Frey, Tarika, Yvette Smith. AD: Say her name. KC: So I said at the beginning, if we can't see a problem, we can't fix a problem. Together, we've come together
to bear witness to these women's lost lives. But the time now is to move from mourning and grief to action and transformation. This is something that we can do. It's up to us. Thank you for joining us. Thank you. (Applause)",2016-12-07T17:40:04Z
What reality are you creating for yourself?,Isaac Lidsky,662923,20183,410,"Reality isn't something you perceive; it's something you create in your mind. Isaac Lidsky learned this profound lesson firsthand, ...","When Dorothy was a little girl, she was fascinated by her goldfish. Her father explained to her that fish swim
by quickly wagging their tails to propel themselves through the water. Without hesitation,
little Dorothy responded, ""Yes, Daddy, and fish swim backwards
by wagging their heads."" (Laughter) In her mind, it was a fact
as true as any other. Fish swim backwards
by wagging their heads. She believed it. Our lives are full
of fish swimming backwards. We make assumptions
and faulty leaps of logic. We harbor bias. We know that we are right,
and they are wrong. We fear the worst. We strive for unattainable perfection. We tell ourselves
what we can and cannot do. In our minds, fish swim by in reverse
frantically wagging their heads and we don't even notice them. I'm going to tell you
five facts about myself. One fact is not true. One: I graduated from Harvard at 19
with an honors degree in mathematics. Two: I currently run
a construction company in Orlando. Three: I starred on a television sitcom. Four: I lost my sight
to a rare genetic eye disease. Five: I served as a law clerk
to two US Supreme Court justices. Which fact is not true? Actually, they're all true. Yeah. They're all true. (Applause) At this point, most people really
only care about the television show. (Laughter) I know this from experience. OK, so the show was NBC's
""Saved by the Bell: The New Class."" And I played Weasel Wyzell, who was the sort of dorky,
nerdy character on the show, which made it a very
major acting challenge for me as a 13-year-old boy. (Laughter) Now, did you struggle
with number four, my blindness? Why is that? We make assumptions
about so-called disabilities. As a blind man, I confront
others' incorrect assumptions about my abilities every day. My point today is not
about my blindness, however. It's about my vision. Going blind taught me
to live my life eyes wide open. It taught me to spot
those backwards-swimming fish that our minds create. Going blind cast them into focus. What does it feel like to see? It's immediate and passive. You open your eyes and there's the world. Seeing is believing. Sight is truth. Right? Well, that's what I thought. Then, from age 12 to 25,
my retinas progressively deteriorated. My sight became an increasingly bizarre carnival funhouse hall
of mirrors and illusions. The salesperson I was relieved
to spot in a store was really a mannequin. Reaching down to wash my hands, I suddenly saw it was
a urinal I was touching, not a sink, when my fingers felt its true shape. A friend described
the photograph in my hand, and only then I could see
the image depicted. Objects appeared, morphed
and disappeared in my reality. It was difficult and exhausting to see. I pieced together fragmented,
transitory images, consciously analyzed the clues, searched for some logic
in my crumbling kaleidoscope, until I saw nothing at all. I learned that what we see is not universal truth. It is not objective reality. What we see is a unique,
personal, virtual reality that is masterfully
constructed by our brain. Let me explain with a bit
of amateur neuroscience. Your visual cortex takes up
about 30 percent of your brain. That's compared to approximately
eight percent for touch and two to three percent for hearing. Every second, your eyes
can send your visual cortex as many as two billion
pieces of information. The rest of your body can send your brain
only an additional billion. So sight is one third
of your brain by volume and can claim about two thirds
of your brain's processing resources. It's no surprise then that the illusion
of sight is so compelling. But make no mistake about it:
sight is an illusion. Here's where it gets interesting. To create the experience of sight, your brain references your conceptual
understanding of the world, other knowledge, your memories,
opinions, emotions, mental attention. All of these things and far more
are linked in your brain to your sight. These linkages work both ways,
and usually occur subconsciously. So for example, what you see impacts how you feel, and the way you feel
can literally change what you see. Numerous studies demonstrate this. If you are asked to estimate the walking speed of a man
in a video, for example, your answer will be different if you're
told to think about cheetahs or turtles. A hill appears steeper
if you've just exercised, and a landmark appears farther away if you're wearing a heavy backpack. We have arrived
at a fundamental contradiction. What you see is a complex
mental construction of your own making, but you experience it passively as a direct representation
of the world around you. You create your own reality,
and you believe it. I believed mine until it broke apart. The deterioration of my eyes
shattered the illusion. You see, sight is just one way we shape our reality. We create our own realities
in many other ways. Let's take fear as just one example. Your fears distort your reality. Under the warped logic of fear,
anything is better than the uncertain. Fear fills the void at all costs, passing off what you dread
for what you know, offering up the worst
in place of the ambiguous, substituting assumption for reason. Psychologists have
a great term for it: awfulizing. (Laughter) Right? Fear replaces the unknown with the awful. Now, fear is self-realizing. When you face the greatest need to look outside yourself
and think critically, fear beats a retreat
deep inside your mind, shrinking and distorting your view, drowning your capacity
for critical thought with a flood of disruptive emotions. When you face a compelling
opportunity to take action, fear lulls you into inaction, enticing you to passively watch
its prophecies fulfill themselves. When I was diagnosed
with my blinding disease, I knew blindness would ruin my life. Blindness was a death sentence
for my independence. It was the end of achievement for me. Blindness meant I would live
an unremarkable life, small and sad, and likely alone. I knew it. This was a fiction born of my fears,
but I believed it. It was a lie, but it was my reality, just like those backwards-swimming fish
in little Dorothy's mind. If I had not confronted
the reality of my fear, I would have lived it. I am certain of that. So how do you live your life
eyes wide open? It is a learned discipline. It can be taught. It can be practiced. I will summarize very briefly. Hold yourself accountable for every moment, every thought, every detail. See beyond your fears. Recognize your assumptions. Harness your internal strength. Silence your internal critic. Correct your misconceptions
about luck and about success. Accept your strengths and your weaknesses,
and understand the difference. Open your hearts to your bountiful blessings. Your fears, your critics, your heroes, your villains -- they are your excuses, rationalizations, shortcuts, justifications, your surrender. They are fictions you perceive as reality. Choose to see through them. Choose to let them go. You are the creator of your reality. With that empowerment
comes complete responsibility. I chose to step out of fear's tunnel
into terrain uncharted and undefined. I chose to build there a blessed life. Far from alone, I share my beautiful life with Dorothy, my beautiful wife, with our triplets,
whom we call the Tripskys, and with the latest addition
to the family, sweet baby Clementine. What do you fear? What lies do you tell yourself? How do you embellish your truth
and write your own fictions? What reality are you
creating for yourself? In your career and personal life,
in your relationships, and in your heart and soul, your backwards-swimming fish
do you great harm. They exact a toll in missed opportunities
and unrealized potential, and they engender insecurity and distrust where you seek fulfillment and connection. I urge you to search them out. Helen Keller said that the only thing
worse than being blind is having sight but no vision. For me, going blind
was a profound blessing, because blindness gave me vision. I hope you can see what I see. Thank you. (Applause) Bruno Giussani: Isaac, before you
leave the stage, just a question. This is an audience of entrepreneurs,
of doers, of innovators. You are a CEO of a company
down in Florida, and many are probably wondering, how is it to be a blind CEO? What kind of specific challenges
do you have, and how do you overcome them? Isaac Lidsky: Well,
the biggest challenge became a blessing. I don't get visual feedback from people. (Laughter) BG: What's that noise there? IL: Yeah. So, for example,
in my leadership team meetings, I don't see facial
expressions or gestures. I've learned to solicit
a lot more verbal feedback. I basically force people
to tell me what they think. And in this respect, it's become, like I said, a real blessing
for me personally and for my company, because we communicate
at a far deeper level, we avoid ambiguities, and most important, my team knows
that what they think truly matters. BG: Isaac, thank you for coming to TED.
IL: Thank you, Bruno. (Applause)",2016-10-27T15:19:44Z
America’s Forgotten Working Class,J.D. Vance,1442414,42826,5499,"J.D. Vance grew up in a small, poor city in the Rust Belt of southern Ohio, where he had a front-row seat to many of the social ills ...","I remember the very first time
I went to a nice restaurant, a really nice restaurant. It was for a law firm recruitment dinner, and I remember beforehand
the waitress walked around and asked whether we wanted some wine, so I said, ""Sure,
I'll take some white wine."" And she immediately said, ""Would you like sauvignon blanc
or chardonnay?"" And I remember thinking, ""Come on, lady,
stop with the fancy French words and just give me some white wine."" But I used my powers of deduction and recognized that chardonnay
and sauvignon blanc were two separate types of white wine, and so I told her
that I would take the chardonnay, because frankly that was
the easiest one to pronounce for me. So I had a lot of experiences like that during my first couple of years
as a law student at Yale, because, despite all outward appearances,
I'm a cultural outsider. I didn't come from the elites. I didn't come from the Northeast
or from San Francisco. I came from a southern Ohio steel town, and it's a town that's really
struggling in a lot of ways, ways that are indicative
of the broader struggles of America's working class. Heroin has moved in, killing a lot of people, people I know. Family violence, domestic violence,
and divorce have torn apart families. And there's a very unique
sense of pessimism that's moved in. Think about rising mortality rates
in these communities and recognize that
for a lot of these folks, the problems that they're seeing are actually causing rising death rates
in their own communities, so there's a very real sense of struggle. I had a very front-row seat
to that struggle. My family has been part of that struggle
for a very long time. I come from a family
that doesn't have a whole lot of money. The addiction that plagued my community also plagued my family,
and even, sadly, my own mom. There were a lot of problems
that I saw in my own family, problems caused sometimes
by a lack of money, problems caused sometimes by a lack
of access to resources and social capital that really affected my life. If you had looked at my life
when I was 14 years old and said, ""Well, what's going
to happen to this kid?"" you would have concluded
that I would have struggled with what academics call upward mobility. So upward mobility is an abstract term, but it strikes at something
that's very core at the heart of the American Dream. It's the sense, and it measures whether kids like me who grow up in poor communities
are going to live a better life, whether they're going to have a chance
to live a materially better existence, or whether they're going to stay
in the circumstances where they came from. And one of the things
we've learned, unfortunately, is that upward mobility isn't as high
as we'd like it to be in this country, and interestingly,
it's very geographically distributed. So take Utah, for instance. In Utah a poor kid is actually doing OK, very likely to live their share
and their part in the American Dream. But if you think of where I'm from, in the South, in Appalachia,
in southern Ohio, it's very unlikely
that kids like that will rise. The American Dream
in those parts of the country is in a very real sense just a dream. So why is that happening? So one reason is obviously
economic or structural. So you think of these areas. They're beset by these
terrible economic trends, built around industries
like coal and steel that make it harder
for folks to get ahead. That's certainly one problem. There's also the problem of brain drain,
where the really talented people, because they can't find
high-skilled work at home, end up moving elsewhere, so they don't build a business
or non-profit where they're from, they end up going elsewhere
and taking their talents with them. There are failing schools
in a lot of these communities, failing to give kids
the educational leg up that really makes it possible for kids
to have opportunities later in life. These things are all important. I don't mean to discount
these structural barriers. But when I look back at my life
and my community, something else was going on,
something else mattered. It's difficult to quantify,
but it was no less real. So for starters, there was
a very real sense of hopelessness in the community that I grew up in. There was a sense that kids had
that their choices didn't matter. No matter what happened,
no matter how hard they worked, no matter how hard
they tried to get ahead, nothing good would happen. So that's a tough feeling
to grow up around. That's a tough mindset to penetrate, and it leads sometimes
to very conspiratorial places. So let's just take one
political issue that's pretty hot, affirmative action. So depending on your politics,
you might think that affirmative action is either a wise or an unwise way
to promote diversity in the workplace or the classroom. But if you grow up in an area like this, you see affirmative action
as a tool to hold people like you back. That's especially true if you're
a member of the white working class. You see it as something
that isn't just about good or bad policy. You see it as something
that's actively conspiring, where people with political
and financial power are working against you. And there are a lot of ways that you see
that conspiracy against you -- perceived, real, but it's there, and it warps expectations. So if you think about what do you do
when you grow up in that world, you can respond in a couple of ways. One, you can say,
""I'm not going to work hard, because no matter how hard I work,
it's not going to matter."" Another thing you might do is say, ""Well, I'm not going to go
after the traditional markers of success, like a university education
or a prestigious job, because the people who care
about those things are unlike me. They're never going to let me in."" When I got admitted to Yale,
a family member asked me if I had pretended to be a liberal
to get by the admissions committee. Seriously. And it's obviously not the case
that there was a liberal box to check on the application, but it speaks to a very real
insecurity in these places that you have to pretend
to be somebody you're not to get past these various social barriers. It's a very significant problem. Even if you don't give in
to that hopelessness, even if you think, let's say, that your choices matter
and you want to make the good choices, you want to do better
for yourself and for your family, it's sometimes hard
to even know what those choices are when you grow up
in a community like I did. I didn't know, for example, that you had to go
to law school to be a lawyer. I didn't know that elite universities,
as research consistently tells us, are cheaper for low-income kids because these universities
have bigger endowments, can offer more generous financial aid. I remember I learned this when I got the financial aid letter
from Yale for myself, tens of thousands of dollars
in need-based aid, which is a term I had never heard before. But I turned to my aunt
when I got that letter and said, ""You know, I think this just means
that for the first time in my life, being poor has paid really well."" So I didn't have access
to that information because the social networks around me
didn't have access to that information. I learned from my community
how to shoot a gun, how to shoot it well. I learned how to make
a damn good biscuit recipe. The trick, by the way,
is frozen butter, not warm butter. But I didn't learn how to get ahead. I didn't learn how to make
the good decisions about education and opportunity that you need to make to actually have a chance
in this 21st century knowledge economy. Economists call the value
that we gain from our informal networks, from our friends and colleagues
and family ""social capital."" The social capital that I had
wasn't built for 21st century America, and it showed. There's something else
that's really important that's going on that our community
doesn't like to talk about, but it's very real. Working-class kids are much more likely to face what's called
adverse childhood experiences, which is just a fancy word
for childhood trauma: getting hit or yelled at,
put down by a parent repeatedly, watching someone hit or beat your parent, watching someone do drugs
or abuse alcohol. These are all instances
of childhood trauma, and they're pretty
commonplace in my family. Importantly, they're not just
commonplace in my family right now. They're also multigenerational. So my grandparents, the very first time that they had kids, they expected that they
were going to raise them in a way that was uniquely good. They were middle class, they were able to earn
a good wage in a steel mill. But what ended up happening is that they exposed their kids
to a lot of the childhood trauma that had gone back many generations. My mom was 12 when she saw
my grandma set my grandfather on fire. His crime was that he came home drunk after she told him, ""If you come home drunk,
I'm gonna kill you."" And she tried to do it. Think about the way
that that affects a child's mind. And we think of these things
as especially rare, but a study by the Wisconsin
Children's Trust Fund found that 40 percent of low-income kids face
multiple instances of childhood trauma, compared to only 29 percent
for upper-income kids. And think about what that really means. If you're a low-income kid, almost half of you face multiple
instances of childhood trauma. This is not an isolated problem. This is a very significant issue. We know what happens
to the kids who experience that life. They're more likely to do drugs,
more likely to go to jail, more likely to drop out of high school, and most importantly, they're more likely
to do to their children what their parents did to them. This trauma, this chaos in the home, is our culture's
very worst gift to our children, and it's a gift that keeps on giving. So you combine all that, the hopelessness, the despair, the cynicism about the future, the childhood trauma, the low social capital, and you begin to understand why me, at the age of 14, was ready to become
just another statistic, another kid who failed to beat the odds. But something unexpected happened. I did beat the odds. Things turned up for me. I graduated from high school,
from college, I went to law school, and I have a pretty good job now. So what happened? Well, one thing that happened
is that my grandparents, the same grandparents
of setting someone on fire fame, they really shaped up
by the time I came around. They provided me a stable home, a stable family. They made sure that when my parents weren't able
to do the things that kids need, they stepped in and filled that role. My grandma especially
did two things that really matter. One, she provided that peaceful home
that allowed me to focus on homework and the things that kids
should be focused on. But she was also
this incredibly perceptive woman, despite not even having
a middle school education. She recognized the message
that my community had for me, that my choices didn't matter, that the deck was stacked against me. She once told me, ""JD, never be like those losers who think
the deck is stacked against them. You can do anything you want to."" And yet she recognized
that life wasn't fair. It's hard to strike that balance, to tell a kid that life isn't fair, but also recognize and enforce in them
the reality that their choices matter. But mamaw was able
to strike that balance. The other thing that really helped
was the United States Marine Corps. So we think of the Marine Corps
as a military outfit, and of course it is, but for me, the US Marine Corps
was a four-year crash course in character education. It taught me how to make a bed,
how to do laundry, how to wake up early,
how to manage my finances. These are things
my community didn't teach me. I remember when I went
to go buy a car for the very first time, I was offered a dealer's
low, low interest rate of 21.9 percent, and I was ready
to sign on the dotted line. But I didn't take that deal, because I went and took it to my officer who told me, ""Stop being an idiot, go to the local credit union,
and get a better deal."" And so that's what I did. But without the Marine Corps, I would have never had access
to that knowledge. I would have had
a financial calamity, frankly. The last thing I want to say
is that I had a lot of good fortune in the mentors and people who have played
an important role in my life. From the Marines,
from Ohio State, from Yale, from other places, people have really stepped in and ensured that they filled
that social capital gap that it was pretty obvious,
apparently, that I had. That comes from good fortune, but a lot of children
aren't going to have that good fortune, and I think that raises
really important questions for all of us about how we're going to change that. We need to ask questions about
how we're going to give low-income kids who come from a broken home
access to a loving home. We need to ask questions about how we're going
to teach low-income parents how to better interact
with their children, with their partners. We need to ask questions
about how we give social capital, mentorship to low-income kids
who don't have it. We need to think about
how we teach working class children about not just hard skills, like reading, mathematics, but also soft skills, like conflict resolution
and financial management. Now, I don't have all of the answers. I don't know all of the solutions
to this problem, but I do know this: in southern Ohio right now, there's a kid who is
anxiously awaiting their dad, wondering whether,
when he comes through the door, he'll walk calmly or stumble drunkly. There's a kid whose mom sticks a needle in her arm and passes out, and he doesn't know
why she doesn't cook him dinner, and he goes to bed hungry that night. There's a kid who has
no hope for the future but desperately
wants to live a better life. They just want somebody
to show it to them. I don't have all the answers, but I know that unless our society
starts asking better questions about why I was so lucky and about how to get that luck
to more of our communities and our country's children, we're going to continue
to have a very significant problem. Thank you. (Applause)",2016-10-17T15:16:06Z
How to Raise Successful Kids -- Without Over-Parenting,Julie Lythcott-Haims,3930795,94642,2165,"By loading kids with high expectations and micromanaging their lives at every turn, parents aren't actually helping. At least, that's ...","You know, I didn't set out
to be a parenting expert. In fact, I'm not very interested
in parenting, per Se. It's just that there's a certain style
of parenting these days that is kind of messing up kids, impeding their chances
to develop into theirselves. There's a certain style
of parenting these days that's getting in the way. I guess what I'm saying is, we spend a lot of time
being very concerned about parents who aren't involved enough
in the lives of their kids and their education or their upbringing, and rightly so. But at the other end of the spectrum, there's a lot of harm
going on there as well, where parents feel
a kid can't be successful unless the parent is protecting
and preventing at every turn and hovering over every happening,
and micromanaging every moment, and steering their kid towards
some small subset of colleges and careers. When we raise kids this way, and I'll say we, because Lord knows,
in raising my two teenagers, I've had these tendencies myself, our kids end up leading
a kind of checklisted childhood. And here's what the checklisted
childhood looks like. We keep them safe and sound and fed and watered, and then we want to be sure
they go to the right schools, that they're in the right classes
at the right schools, and that they get the right grades
in the right classes in the right schools. But not just the grades, the scores, and not just the grades and scores,
but the accolades and the awards and the sports,
the activities, the leadership. We tell our kids, don't just join a club, start a club, because colleges
want to see that. And check the box for community service. I mean, show the colleges
you care about others. (Laughter) And all of this is done to some
hoped-for degree of perfection. We expect our kids
to perform at a level of perfection we were never asked
to perform at ourselves, and so because so much is required, we think, well then, of course we parents
have to argue with every teacher and principal and coach and referee and act like our kid's concierge and personal handler and secretary. And then with our kids, our precious kids, we spend so much time nudging, cajoling, hinting, helping, haggling,
nagging as the case may be, to be sure they're not screwing up, not closing doors, not ruining their future, some hoped-for admission to a tiny handful of colleges that deny almost every applicant. And here's what it feels like
to be a kid in this checklisted childhood. First of all, there's
no time for free play. There's no room in the afternoons, because everything
has to be enriching, we think. It's as if every piece of homework,
every quiz, every activity is a make-or-break moment
for this future we have in mind for them, and we absolve them
of helping out around the house, and we even absolve them
of getting enough sleep as long as they're checking off
the items on their checklist. And in the checklisted childhood,
we say we just want them to be happy, but when they come home from school, what we ask about all too often first is their homework and their grades. And they see in our faces that our approval, that our love, that their very worth, comes from A's. And then we walk alongside them and offer clucking praise like a trainer
at the Westminster Dog Show -- (Laughter) coaxing them to just jump a little higher
and soar a little farther, day after day after day. And when they get to high school, they don't say, ""Well, what might I
be interested in studying or doing as an activity?"" They go to counselors and they say, ""What do I need to do
to get into the right college?"" And then, when the grades
start to roll in in high school, and they're getting some B's, or God forbid some C's, they frantically text their friends and say, ""Has anyone ever gotten
into the right college with these grades?"" And our kids, regardless of where they end up
at the end of high school, they're breathless. They're brittle. They're a little burned out. They're a little old before their time, wishing the grown-ups in their lives
had said, ""What you've done is enough, this effort you've put forth
in childhood is enough."" And they're withering now
under high rates of anxiety and depression and some of them are wondering, will this life ever turn out
to have been worth it? Well, we parents, we parents are pretty sure
it's all worth it. We seem to behave -- it's like we literally think
they will have no future if they don't get into one of these
tiny set of colleges or careers we have in mind for them. Or maybe, maybe, we're just afraid they won't have a future we can brag about to our friends and with stickers
on the backs of our cars. Yeah. (Applause) But if you look at what we've done, if you have the courage
to really look at it, you'll see that not only do our kids
think their worth comes from grades and scores, but that when we live right up inside
their precious developing minds all the time, like our very own version
of the movie ""Being John Malkovich,"" we send our children the message: ""Hey kid, I don't think you can actually
achieve any of this without me."" And so with our overhelp, our overprotection
and overdirection and hand-holding, we deprive our kids
of the chance to build self-efficacy, which is a really fundamental tenet
of the human psyche, far more important
than that self-esteem they get every time we applaud. Self-efficacy is built when one sees
that one's own actions lead to outcomes, not -- There you go. (Applause) Not one's parents'
actions on one's behalf, but when one's own actions
lead to outcomes. So simply put, if our children are to develop
self-efficacy, and they must, then they have to do a whole lot more
of the thinking, planning, deciding, doing, hoping, coping, trial and error, dreaming and experiencing of life for themselves. Now, am I saying every kid is hard-working and motivated and doesn't need a parent's involvement
or interest in their lives, and we should just back off and let go? Hell no. (Laughter) That is not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is, when we treat
grades and scores and accolades and awards as the purpose of childhood, all in furtherance of some hoped-for
admission to a tiny number of colleges or entrance to a small number of careers, that that's too narrow a definition
of success for our kids. And even though we might help them
achieve some short-term wins by overhelping -- like they get a better grade
if we help them do their homework, they might end up with a longer
childhood résumé when we help -- what I'm saying is that all of this
comes at a long-term cost to their sense of self. What I'm saying is,
we should be less concerned with the specific set of colleges they might be able
to apply to or might get into and far more concerned that they have
the habits, the mindset, the skill set, the wellness, to be successful
wherever they go. What I'm saying is, our kids need us to be a little
less obsessed with grades and scores and a whole lot more interested in childhood providing
a foundation for their success built on things like love and chores. (Laughter) (Applause) Did I just say chores?
Did I just say chores? I really did. But really, here's why. The longest longitudinal study
of humans ever conducted is called the Harvard Grant Study. It found that professional
success in life, which is what we want for our kids, that professional success in life
comes from having done chores as a kid, and the earlier you started, the better, that a roll-up-your-sleeves-
and-pitch-in mindset, a mindset that says,
there's some unpleasant work, someone's got to do it,
it might as well be me, a mindset that says, I will contribute my effort
to the betterment of the whole, that that's what gets you ahead
in the workplace. Now, we all know this. You know this. (Applause) We all know this, and yet,
in the checklisted childhood, we absolve our kids of doing
the work of chores around the house, and then they end up
as young adults in the workplace still waiting for a checklist, but it doesn't exist, and more importantly,
lacking the impulse, the instinct to roll up their sleeves and pitch in and look around and wonder,
how can I be useful to my colleagues? How can I anticipate a few steps ahead
to what my boss might need? A second very important finding
from the Harvard Grant Study said that happiness in life comes from love, not love of work, love of humans: our spouse, our partner,
our friends, our family. So childhood needs to teach
our kids how to love, and they can't love others
if they don't first love themselves, and they won't love themselves
if we can't offer them unconditional love. (Applause) Right. And so, instead of being obsessed
with grades and scores when our precious offspring
come home from school, or we come home from work, we need to close our technology,
put away our phones, and look them in the eye and let them see
the joy that fills our faces when we see our child
for the first time in a few hours. And then we have to say, ""How was your day? What did you like about today?"" And when your teenage daughter
says, ""Lunch,"" like mine did, and I want to hear about the math test, not lunch, you have to still
take an interest in lunch. You gotta say, ""What was great
about lunch today?"" They need to know
they matter to us as humans, not because of their GPA. All right, so you're thinking,
chores and love, that sounds all well and good,
but give me a break. The colleges want to see
top scores and grades and accolades and awards,
and I'm going to tell you, sort of. The very biggest brand-name schools
are asking that of our young adults, but here's the good news. Contrary to what the college
rankings racket would have us believe -- (Applause) you don't have to go to one
of the biggest brand name schools to be happy and successful in life. Happy and successful people
went to state school, went to a small college
no one has heard of, went to community college, went to a college over here
and flunked out. (Applause) The evidence is in this room,
is in our communities, that this is the truth. And if we could widen our blinders and be willing to look
at a few more colleges, maybe remove our own egos
from the equation, we could accept and embrace
this truth and then realize, it is hardly the end of the world if our kids don't go to one
of those big brand-name schools. And more importantly, if their childhood has not been lived
according to a tyrannical checklist then when they get to college, whichever one it is, well, they'll have gone there
on their own volition, fueled by their own desire, capable and ready to thrive there. I have to admit something to you. I've got two kids I mentioned,
Sawyer and Avery. They're teenagers. And once upon a time, I think I was treating my Sawyer and Avery like little bonsai trees -- (Laughter) that I was going
to carefully clip and prune and shape into some perfect
form of a human that might just be perfect enough
to warrant them admission to one of the most
highly selective colleges. But I've come to realize, after working
with thousands of other people's kids -- (Laughter) and raising two kids of my own, my kids aren't bonsai trees. They're wildflowers of an unknown genus and species -- (Laughter) and it's my job to provide
a nourishing environment, to strengthen them through chores and to love them so they can
love others and receive love and the college, the major, the career, that's up to them. My job is not to make them become
what I would have them become, but to support them
in becoming their glorious selves. Thank you. (Applause)",2016-10-04T17:38:46Z
"Who are you, really? The puzzle of personality",Brian Little,12856391,310283,4572,"Visit http://TED.com to get our entire library of TED Talks, transcripts, translations, personalized talk recommendations and more.","What an intriguing
group of individuals you are ... to a psychologist. (Laughter) I've had the opportunity
over the last couple of days of listening in on some
of your conversations and watching you interact with each other. And I think it's fair to say, already, that there are 47 people in this audience, at this moment, displaying psychological symptoms
I would like to discuss today. (Laughter) And I thought you might
like to know who you are. (Laughter) But instead of pointing at you, which would be gratuitous and intrusive, I thought I would tell you
a few facts and stories, in which you may catch
a glimpse of yourself. I'm in the field of research
known as personality psychology, which is part of a larger
personality science which spans the full spectrum,
from neurons to narratives. And what we try to do, in our own way, is to make sense of how each of us -- each of you -- is, in certain respects, like all other people, like some other people and like no other person. Now, already you may
be saying of yourself, ""I'm not intriguing. I am the 46th most boring person
in the Western Hemisphere."" Or you may say of yourself, ""I am intriguing, even if I am regarded by most people
as a great, thundering twit."" (Laughter) But it is your self-diagnosed boringness
and your inherent ""twitiness"" that makes me, as a psychologist,
really fascinated by you. So let me explain why this is so. One of the most influential approaches
in personality science is known as trait psychology, and it aligns you along five dimensions
which are normally distributed, and that describe universally held aspects
of difference between people. They spell out the acronym OCEAN. So, ""O"" stands for ""open to experience,"" versus those who are more closed. ""C"" stands for ""conscientiousness,"" in contrast to those with a more
lackadaisical approach to life. ""E"" -- ""extroversion,"" in contrast
to more introverted people. ""A"" -- ""agreeable individuals,"" in contrast to those
decidedly not agreeable. And ""N"" -- ""neurotic individuals,"" in contrast to those who are more stable. All of these dimensions have
implications for our well-being, for how our life goes. And so we know that, for example, openness and conscientiousness
are very good predictors of life success, but the open people achieve that success
through being audacious and, occasionally, odd. The conscientious people
achieve it through sticking to deadlines, to persevering, as well as
having some passion. Extroversion and agreeableness
are both conducive to working well with people. Extroverts, for example,
I find intriguing. With my classes, I sometimes
give them a basic fact that might be revealing
with respect to their personality: I tell them that it is virtually
impossible for adults to lick the outside of their own elbow. (Laughter) Did you know that? Already, some of you have tried
to lick the outside of your own elbow. But extroverts amongst you are probably those
who have not only tried, but they have successfully
licked the elbow of the person sitting next to them. (Laughter) Those are the extroverts. Let me deal in a bit more detail
with extroversion, because it's consequential
and it's intriguing, and it helps us understand
what I call our three natures. First, our biogenic nature --
our neurophysiology. Second, our sociogenic or second nature, which has to do with the cultural
and social aspects of our lives. And third, what makes you
individually you -- idiosyncratic -- what I call your ""idiogenic"" nature. Let me explain. One of the things that characterizes
extroverts is they need stimulation. And that stimulation can be achieved
by finding things that are exciting: loud noises, parties
and social events here at TED -- you see the extroverts
forming a magnetic core. They all gather together. And I've seen you. The introverts are more likely
to spend time in the quiet spaces up on the second floor, where they are able
to reduce stimulation -- and may be misconstrued
as being antisocial, but you're not necessarily antisocial. It may be that you simply realize
that you do better when you have a chance
to lower that level of stimulation. Sometimes it's an internal
stimulant, from your body. Caffeine, for example, works much better
with extroverts than it does introverts. When extroverts come into the office
at nine o'clock in the morning and say, ""I really need a cup of coffee,"" they're not kidding -- they really do. Introverts do not do as well, particularly if the tasks
they're engaged in -- and they've had some coffee -- if those tasks are speeded, and if they're quantitative, introverts may give the appearance
of not being particularly quantitative. But it's a misconstrual. So here are the consequences
that are really quite intriguing: we're not always what seem to be, and that takes me to my next point. I should say, before getting to this, something about sexual intercourse, although I may not have time. And so, if you would like me to -- yes, you would? OK. (Laughter) There are studies done on the frequency with which
individuals engage in the conjugal act, as broken down by male, female;
introvert, extrovert. So I ask you: How many times per minute -- oh, I'm sorry, that was a rat study -- (Laughter) How many times per month do introverted men engage in the act? 3.0. Extroverted men? More or less? Yes, more. 5.5 -- almost twice as much. Introverted women: 3.1. Extroverted women? Frankly, speaking as an introverted male, which I will explain later -- they are heroic. 7.5. They not only handle
all the male extroverts, they pick up a few introverts as well. (Laughter) (Applause) We communicate differently,
extroverts and introverts. Extroverts, when they interact, want to have lots of social encounter
punctuated by closeness. They'd like to stand close
for comfortable communication. They like to have a lot of eye contact, or mutual gaze. We found in some research that they use more diminutive terms
when they meet somebody. So when an extrovert meets a Charles, it rapidly becomes ""Charlie,""
and then ""Chuck,"" and then ""Chuckles Baby."" (Laughter) Whereas for introverts, it remains ""Charles,"" until he's given
a pass to be more intimate by the person he's talking to. We speak differently. Extroverts prefer black-and-white,
concrete, simple language. Introverts prefer --
and I must again tell you that I am as extreme an introvert
as you could possibly imagine -- we speak differently. We prefer contextually complex, contingent, weasel-word sentences -- (Laughter) More or less. (Laughter) As it were. (Laughter) Not to put too fine a point upon it -- like that. When we talk, we sometimes talk past each other. I had a consulting contract
I shared with a colleague who's as different from me
as two people can possibly be. First, his name is Tom. Mine isn't. (Laughter) Secondly, he's six foot five. I have a tendency not to be. (Laughter) And thirdly, he's as extroverted
a person as you could find. I am seriously introverted. I overload so much, I can't even have a cup of coffee
after three in the afternoon and expect to sleep in the evening. We had seconded to this project
a fellow called Michael. And Michael almost brought
the project to a crashing halt. So the person who seconded him
asked Tom and me, ""What do you make of Michael?"" Well, I'll tell you
what Tom said in a minute. He spoke in classic ""extrovert-ese."" And here is how extroverted ears
heard what I said, which is actually pretty accurate. I said, ""Well Michael does have
a tendency at times of behaving in a way
that some of us might see as perhaps more assertive
than is normally called for."" (Laughter) Tom rolled his eyes and he said, ""Brian, that's what I said: he's an asshole!"" (Laughter) (Applause) Now, as an introvert, I might gently allude to certain
""assholic"" qualities in this man's behavior, but I'm not going to lunge for the a-word. (Laughter) But the extrovert says, ""If he walks like one, if he talks
like one, I call him one."" And we go past each other. Now is this something
that we should be heedful of? Of course. It's important that we know this. Is that all we are? Are we just a bunch of traits? No, we're not. Remember, you're like some other people and like no other person. How about that idiosyncratic you? As Elizabeth or as George, you may share your extroversion
or your neuroticism. But are there some distinctively
Elizabethan features of your behavior, or Georgian of yours, that make us understand you
better than just a bunch of traits? That make us love you? Not just because you're
a certain type of person. I'm uncomfortable putting
people in pigeonholes. I don't even think pigeons
belong in pigeonholes. So what is it that makes us different? It's the doings that we have
in our life -- the personal projects. You have a personal project right now, but nobody may know it here. It relates to your kid -- you've been back three times
to the hospital, and they still don't know what's wrong. Or it could be your mom. And you'd been acting out of character. These are free traits. You're very agreeable,
but you act disagreeably in order to break down those barriers
of administrative torpor in the hospital, to get something
for your mom or your child. What are these free traits? They're where we enact a script in order to advance
a core project in our lives. And they are what matters. Don't ask people what type you are; ask them, ""What are your core
projects in your life?"" And we enact those free traits. I'm an introvert, but I have a core project,
which is to profess. I'm a professor. And I adore my students, and I adore my field. And I can't wait to tell them
about what's new, what's exciting, what I can't wait to tell them about. And so I act in an extroverted way, because at eight in the morning, the students need a little bit of humor, a little bit of engagement
to keep them going in arduous days of study. But we need to be very careful when we act protractedly out of character. Sometimes we may find
that we don't take care of ourselves. I find, for example, after a period
of pseudo-extroverted behavior, I need to repair somewhere on my own. As Susan Cain said in her ""Quiet"" book, in a chapter that featured
the strange Canadian professor who was teaching at the time at Harvard, I sometimes go to the men's room to escape the slings and arrows
of outrageous extroverts. (Laughter) I remember one particular day
when I was retired to a cubicle, trying to avoid overstimulation. And a real extrovert came
in beside me -- not right in my cubicle, but in the next cubicle over -- and I could hear various
evacuatory noises, which we hate -- even our own, that's why we flush
during as well as after. (Laughter) And then I heard
this gravelly voice saying, ""Hey, is that Dr. Little?"" (Laughter) If anything is guaranteed
to constipate an introvert for six months, it's talking on the john. (Laughter) That's where I'm going now. Don't follow me. Thank you. (Applause)",2016-07-19T16:56:54Z
My journey from Marine to actor,Adam Driver,12467159,352044,9904,"Visit http://TED.com to get our entire library of TED Talks, transcripts, translations, personalized Talk recommendations and more.","I was a Marine with 1/1 Weapons Company, 81's platoon, out in Camp Pendleton, California. Oorah! Audience: Oorah! (Laughter) I joined a few months after September 11, feeling like I think most people
in the country did at the time, filled with a sense
of patriotism and retribution and the desire to do something -- that, coupled with that fact
that I wasn't doing anything. I was 17, just graduated
from high school that past summer, living in the back room
of my parents' house paying rent, in the small town I was raised in
in Northern Indiana, called Mishawaka. I can spell that later
for people who are interested -- (Laughter) Mishawaka is many good things
but cultural hub of the world it is not, so my only exposure to theater and film was limited to the plays
I did in high school and Blockbuster Video,
may she rest in peace. (Laughter) I was serious enough about acting that I auditioned for Juilliard
when I was a senior in high school, didn't get in, determined college wasn't for me
and applied nowhere else, which was a genius move. I also did that Hail Mary
LA acting odyssey that I always heard stories about, of actors moving to LA
with, like, seven dollars and finding work and successful careers. I got as far as Amarillo, Texas,
before my car broke down. I spent all my money repairing it, finally made it to Santa Monica -- not even LA -- stayed for 48 hours wandering
the beach, basically, got in my car, drove home, thus ending my acting career, so -- (Laughter) Seventeen, Mishawaka ... parents' house, paying rent,
selling vacuums ... telemarketing, cutting grass at the local
4-H fairgrounds. This was my world
going into September, 2001. So after the 11th, and feeling an overwhelming sense of duty, and just being pissed off
in general -- at myself, my parents, the government; not having confidence,
not having a respectable job, my shitty mini-fridge that I just
drove to California and back -- I joined the Marine Corps and loved it.
I loved being a Marine. It's one of the things I'm most proud
of having done in my life. Firing weapons was cool, driving and detonating
expensive things was great. But I found I loved
the Marine Corps the most for the thing I was looking
for the least when I joined, which was the people: these weird dudes --
a motley crew of characters from a cross section
of the United States -- that on the surface I had
nothing in common with. And over time, all the political and personal bravado that led me to the military dissolved, and for me, the Marine Corps
became synonymous with my friends. And then, a few years into my service and months away from deploying to Iraq, I dislocated my sternum
in a mountain-biking accident, and had to be medically separated. Those never in the military
may find this hard to understand, but being told I wasn't getting deployed
to Iraq or Afghanistan was very devastating for me. I have a very clear image of leaving
the base hospital on a stretcher and my entire platoon is waiting
outside to see if I was OK. And then, suddenly,
I was a civilian again. I knew I wanted to give
acting another shot, because -- again, this is me -- I thought all civilian problems
are small compared to the military. I mean, what can you really
bitch about now, you know? ""It's hot. Someone should turn
on the air conditioner."" ""This coffee line is too long."" I was a Marine, I knew how to survive. I'd go to New York and become an actor. If things didn't work out, I'd live in Central Park
and dumpster-dive behind Panera Bread. (Laughter) I re-auditioned for Juilliard
and this time I was lucky, I got in. But I was surprised
by how complex the transition was from military to civilian. And I was relatively healthy; I can't
imagine going through that process on top of a mental or physical injury. But regardless, it was difficult. In part, because I was in acting school -- I couldn't justify going
to voice and speech class, throwing imaginary balls of energy
at the back of the room, doing acting exercises
where I gave birth to myself -- (Laughter) while my friends were serving
without me overseas. But also, because I didn't
know how to apply the things I learned in the military
to a civilian context. I mean that both practically
and emotionally. Practically, I had to get a job. And I was an Infantry Marine, where you're shooting machine guns
and firing mortars. There's not a lot of places you can
put those skills in the civilian world. (Laughter) Emotionally, I struggled to find meaning. In the military, everything has meaning. Everything you do
is either steeped in tradition or has a practical purpose. You can't smoke in the field because you don't want
to give away your position. You don't touch your face --
you have to maintain a personal level of health and hygiene. You face this way when ""Colors"" plays, out of respect for people
who went before you. Walk this way, talk this way
because of this. Your uniform is maintained to the inch. How diligently you followed
those rules spoke volumes about the kind of Marine you were. Your rank said something
about your history and the respect you had earned. In the civilian world there's no rank. Here you're just another body, and I felt like I constantly had
to prove my worth all over again. And the respect civilians were giving me
while I was in uniform didn't exist when I was out of it. There didn't seem to be a ... a sense of community, whereas in the military,
I felt this sense of community. How often in the civilian world are you put in a life-or-death situation
with your closest friends and they constantly demonstrate
that they're not going to abandon you? And meanwhile, at acting school ... (Laughter) I was really, for the first time, discovering playwrights
and characters and plays that had nothing to do with the military, but were somehow describing
my military experience in a way that before
to me was indescribable. And I felt myself becoming less aggressive as I was able to put words
to feelings for the first time and realizing what
a valuable tool that was. And when I was reflecting
on my time in the military, I wasn't first thinking
on the stereotypical drills and discipline and pain of it; but rather, the small,
intimate human moments, moments of great feeling: friends going AWOL
because they missed their families, friends getting divorced, grieving together, celebrating together, all within the backdrop of the military. I saw my friends battling
these circumstances, and I watched the anxiety
it produced in them and me, not being able to express
our feelings about it. The military and theater communities
are actually very similar. You have a group of people
trying to accomplish a mission greater than themselves;
it's not about you. You have a role, you have to know
your role within that team. Every team has a leader or director; sometimes they're smart,
sometimes they're not. You're forced to be intimate
with complete strangers in a short amount of time; the self-discipline, the self-maintenance. I thought, how great would it be
to create a space that combined these two seemingly
dissimilar communities, that brought entertainment
to a group of people that, considering their occupation, could handle something
a bit more thought-provoking than the typical mandatory-fun events that I remember being
""volun-told"" to go to in the military -- (Laughter) all well-intended but slightly
offensive events, like ""Win a Date with a San Diego
Chargers Cheerleader,"" where you answer a question
about pop culture, and if you get it right you win a date, which was a chaperoned walk
around the parade deck with this already married,
pregnant cheerleader -- (Laughter) Nothing against cheerleaders,
I love cheerleaders. The point is more, how great would it
be to have theater presented through characters that were accessible
without being condescending. So we started this nonprofit
called Arts in the Armed Forces, where we tried to do that, tried to join these two seemingly
dissimilar communities. We pick a play or select monologues
from contemporary American plays that are diverse in age and race
like a military audience is, grab a group of incredible
theater-trained actors, arm them with incredible material, keep production value
as minimal as possible -- no sets, no costumes,
no lights, just reading it -- to throw all the emphasis on the language and to show that theater can
be created at any setting. It's a powerful thing, getting in a room with complete strangers and reminding ourselves of our humanity, and that self-expression
is just as valuable a tool as a rifle on your shoulder. And for an organization like the military, that prides itself on having
acronyms for acronyms, you can get lost in the sauce when it comes to explaining
a collective experience. And I can think of no better community to arm with a new means of self-expression than those protecting our country. We've gone all over
the United States and the world, from Walter Reed in Bethesda, Maryland, to Camp Pendleton,
to Camp Arifjan in Kuwait, to USAG Bavaria, on- and off-Broadway theaters in New York. And for the performing artists we bring, it's a window into a culture they otherwise would not
have had exposure to. And for the military, it's the exact same. And in doing this for the past six years, I'm always reminded
that acting is many things. It's a craft, it's a political act,
it's a business, it's -- whatever adjective
is most applicable to you. But it's also a service. I didn't get to finish mine, so whenever I get to be of service to this ultimate service industry,
the military, for me, again -- there's not many things better than that. Thank you. (Applause) We're going to be doing a piece
from Marco Ramirez, called ""I am not Batman."" An incredible actor
and good friend of mine, Jesse Perez, is going to be reading, and Matt Johnson,
who I just met a couple hours ago. They're doing it together
for the first time, so we'll see how it goes. Jesse Perez and Matt Johnson. (Applause) Jesse Perez: It's the middle of the night and the sky is glowing
like mad, radioactive red. And if you squint,
you can maybe see the moon through a thick layer of cigarette smoke
and airplane exhaust that covers the whole city, like a mosquito net
that won't let the angels in. (Drum beat) And if you look up high enough, you can see me standing
on the edge of an 87-story building. And up there, a place for gargoyles
and broken clock towers that have stayed still and dead
for maybe like 100 years, up there is me. (Beat) And I'm frickin' Batman. (Beat) And I gots Batmobiles and batarangs and frickin' bat caves, like, for real. And all it takes is a broom closet or a back room or a fire escape, and Danny's hand-me-down jeans are gone. And my navy blue polo shirt, the one that looks kinda good on me
but has that hole on it near the butt from when it got snagged
on the chain-link fence behind Arturo's but it isn't even a big deal
because I tuck that part in and it's, like, all good. That blue polo shirt -- it's gone, too! And I get like, like ... transformational. (Beat) And nobody pulls out a belt
and whips Batman for talkin' back. (Beat) Or for not talkin' back. And nobody calls Batman simple or stupid or skinny. And nobody fires Batman's brother
from the Eastern Taxi Company 'cause they was making cutbacks, neither. 'Cause they got nothing but respect. And not like afraid-respect, just, like, respect-respect. (Laughter) 'Cause nobody's afraid of you. 'Cause Batman doesn't mean nobody no harm. (Beat) Ever.
(Double beat) 'Cause all Batman really wants
to do is save people and maybe pay abuela's bills one day and die happy. And maybe get, like, mad-famous for real. (Laughter) Oh -- and kill the Joker. (Drum roll) Tonight, like most nights, I'm all alone. And I'm watchin' and I'm waitin' like a eagle or like a -- no, yeah, like a eagle. (Laughter) And my cape is flapping in the wind
cause it's frickin' long and my pointy ears are on, and that mask that covers like half
my face is on, too, and I got, like, bulletproof stuff
all in my chest so no one can hurt me. And nobody -- nobody! -- is gonna come between Batman ... and justice. (Drums)
(Laughter) From where I am, I can hear everything. (Silence) Somewhere in the city, there's a old lady picking
Styrofoam leftovers up out of a trash can and she's putting a piece
of sesame chicken someone spit out into her own mouth. And somewhere there's a doctor
with a wack haircut in a black lab coat trying to find a cure for the diseases that are gonna make us
all extinct for real one day. And somewhere there's a man, a man in a janitor's uniform, stumbling home drunk and dizzy after spending half his paycheck
on 40-ounce bottles of twist-off beer, and the other half on a four-hour visit
to some lady's house on a street where the lights
have all been shot out by people who'd rather do
what they do in this city in the dark. And half a block away from janitor man, there's a group of good-for-nothings
who don't know no better, waiting for janitor man
with rusted bicycle chains and imitation Louisville Sluggers, and if they don't find a cent on him, which they won't, they'll just pound at him till the muscles
in their arms start burning, till there's no more teeth to crack out. But they don't count on me. They don't count on no Dark Knight, with a stomach full of grocery-store
brand macaroni and cheese and cut-up Vienna sausages. (Laughter) 'Cause they'd rather believe
I don't exist. And from 87 stories up, I can hear
one of the good-for-nothings say, ""Gimme the cash!"" -- real fast like that, just, ""Gimme me the fuckin' cash!"" And I see janitor man mumble something
in drunk language and turn pale, and from 87 stories up, I can hear his stomach trying
to hurl its way out his Dickies. So I swoop down, like, mad-fast and I'm like darkness, I'm like, ""Swoosh!"" And I throw a batarang
at the one naked lightbulb. (Cymbal) And they're all like, ""Whoa, muthafucker! Who just turned out the lights?"" (Laughter) ""What's that over there?""
""What?"" ""Gimme me what you got, old man!"" ""Did anybody hear that?"" ""Hear what? There ain't nothing.
No, really -- there ain't no bat!"" But then ... one out of the three good-for-nothings
gets it to the head -- pow! And number two swings blindly
into the dark cape before him, but before his fist hits anything, I grab a trash can lid and -- right in the gut! And number one comes
back with the jump kick, but I know judo karate, too,
so I'm like -- (Drums) Twice! (Drums) (Laughter) (Drums) But before I can do any more damage, suddenly we all hear a ""click-click."" And suddenly everything gets quiet. And the one good-for-nothing left standing grips a handgun and aims it straight up, like he's holding Jesus hostage, like he's threatening maybe
to blow a hole in the moon. And the good-for-nothing
who got it to the head, who tried to jump-kick me, and the other good-for-nothing
who got it in the gut, is both scrambling back away
from the dark figure before 'em. And the drunk man, the janitor man, is huddled in a corner,
praying to Saint Anthony 'cause that's the only one
he could remember. (Double beat) And there's me: eyes glowing white, cape blowing softly in the wind. (Beat) Bulletproof chest heaving, my heart beating right through it
in a Morse code for: ""Fuck with me just once come on just try."" And the one good-for-nothing
left standing, the one with the handgun -- yeah, he laughs. And he lowers his arm. And he points it at me and gives the moon a break. And he aims it right
between my pointy ears, like goal posts and he's special teams. And janitor man is still
calling Saint Anthony, but he ain't pickin' up. And for a second, it seems like ... maybe I'm gonna lose. Nah! (Drums) Shoot! Shoot! Fwa-ka-ka! ""Don't kill me, man!"" Snap! Wrist crack! Neck! Slash! Skin meets acid:
""Ahhhhhhh!"" And he's on the floor and I'm standing over him and I got the gun in my hands now and I hate guns, I hate holding 'em
'cause I'm Batman. And, asterisk: Batman don't like guns 'cause his parents
got iced by guns a long time ago. But for just a second, my eyes glow white, and I hold this thing for I could speak to the good-for-nothing in a language he maybe understands. Click-click! (Beat) And the good-for-nothings
become good-for-disappearing into whatever toxic waste, chemical
sludge shithole they crawled out of. And it's just me and janitor man. And I pick him up, and I wipe sweat and cheap perfume
off his forehead. And he begs me not to hurt him and I grab him tight
by his janitor-man shirt collar, and I pull him to my face and he's taller than me
but the cape helps, so he listens when I look him
straight in the eyes. And I say two words to him: ""Go home."" And he does, checking behind his shoulder
every 10 feet. And I swoosh from building
to building on his way there 'cause I know where he lives. And I watch his hands tremble
as he pulls out his key chain and opens the door to his building. And I'm back in bed before he even walks in
through the front door. And I hear him turn on the faucet and pour himself a glass
of warm tap water. And he puts the glass back in the sink. And I hear his footsteps. And they get slower
as they get to my room. And he creaks my door open,
like, mad-slow. And he takes a step in, which he never does. (Beat) And he's staring off into nowhere, his face, the color
of sidewalks in summer. And I act like I'm just waking up and I say, ""Ah, what's up, Pop?"" And janitor man says nothing to me. But I see in the dark, I see his arms go limp and his head turns back, like, towards me. And he lifts it for I can see his face, for I could see his eyes. And his cheeks is drippin',
but not with sweat. And he just stands there breathing, like he remembers my eyes glowing white, like he remembers my bulletproof chest, like he remembers he's my pop. And for a long time I don't say nothin'. And he turns around, hand on the doorknob. And he ain't looking my way, but I hear him mumble two words to me: ""I'm sorry."" And I lean over, and I open
my window just a crack. If you look up high enough, you could see me. And from where I am -- (Cymbals) I could hear everything. (Applause) Thank you. (Applause)",2016-06-21T15:56:49Z
The mind behind Linux,Linus Torvalds,5939933,144946,5368,"Linus Torvalds transformed technology twice — first with the Linux kernel, which helps power the Internet, and again with Git, the ...","Chris Anderson: This is such
a strange thing. Your software, Linux,
is in millions of computers, it probably powers much of the Internet. And I think that there are, like, a billion and a half active
Android devices out there. Your software is in every
single one of them. It's kind of amazing. You must have some amazing
software headquarters driving all this. That's what I thought -- and I was shocked
when I saw a picture of it. I mean, this is -- this is the Linux world headquarters. (Laughter) (Applause) Linus Torvalds: It really
doesn't look like much. And I have to say, the most interesting part in this picture, that people mostly react to, is the walking desk. It is the most interesting
part in my office and I'm not actually using it anymore. And I think the two things are related. The way I work is ... I want to not have external stimulation. You can kind of see,
on the walls are this light green. I'm told that at mental institutions
they use that on the walls. (Laughter) It's like a calming color, it's not something
that really stimulates you. What you can't see is the computer here,
you only see the screen, but the main thing I worry
about in my computer is -- it doesn't have to be big
and powerful, although I like that -- it really has to be completely silent. I know people who work for Google and they have their own
small data center at home, and I don't do that. My office is the most
boring office you'll ever see. And I sit there alone in the quiet. If the cat comes up, it sits in my lap. And I want to hear the cat purring, not the sound of the fans in the computer. CA: So this is astonishing, because working this way, you're able to run this vast
technology empire -- it is an empire -- so that's an amazing testament
to the power of open source. Tell us how you got
to understand open source and how it lead
to the development of Linux. LT: I mean, I still work alone. Really -- I work alone in my house, often in my bathrobe. When a photographer shows up, I dress up, so I have clothes on. (Laughter) And that's how I've always worked. I mean, this was how I started Linux, too. I did not start Linux
as a collaborative project. I started it as one
in a series of many projects I had done at the time for myself, partly because I needed the end result, but even more because I just
enjoyed programming. So it was about the end of the journey, which, 25 years later,
we still have not reached. But it was really about the fact
that I was looking for a project on my own and there was no open source,
really, on my radar at all. And what happened is ... the project grows and becomes something
you want to show off to people. Really, this is more of a, ""Wow,
look at what I did!"" And trust me -- it was not
that great back then. I made it publicly available, and it wasn't even
open source at that point. At that point it was source that was open,
but there was no intention behind using the kind of open-source
methodology that we think of today to improve it. It was more like, ""Look, I've been working
on this for half a year, I'd love to have comments."" And other people approached me. At the University of Helsinki, I had a friend who was one
of the open source -- it was called mainly
""free software"" back then -- and he actually introduced me
to the notion that, hey, you can use these open-source
licenses that had been around. And I thought about it for a while. I was actually worried about the whole
commercial interests coming in. I mean, that's one of the worries
I think most people who start out have, is that they worry about somebody
taking advantage of their work, right? And I decided, ""What the hell?"" And -- CA: And then at some point, someone contributed
some code that you thought, ""Wow, that really is interesting,
I would not have thought of that. This could actually improve this."" LT: It didn't even start
by people contributing code, it was more that people
started contributing ideas. And just the fact that somebody else
takes a look at your project -- and I'm sure it's true
of other things, too, but it's definitely true in code -- is that somebody else
takes an interest in your code, looks at it enough to actually
give you feedback and give you ideas. That was a huge thing for me. I was 21 at the time, so I was young, but I had already programmed
for half my life, basically. And every project before that
had been completely personal and it was a revelation when people
just started commenting, started giving feedback on your code. And even before they started
giving code back, that was, I think, one of the big
moments where I said, ""I love other people!"" Don't get me wrong -- I'm actually not a people person. (Laughter) I don't really love other people -- (Laughter) But I love computers, I love interacting with other
people on email, because it kind of gives you that buffer. But I do love other people who comment
and get involved in my project. And it made it so much more. CA: So was there a moment
when you saw what was being built and it suddenly started taking off, and you thought, ""Wait a sec,
this actually could be something huge, not just a personal project
that I'm getting nice feedback on, but a kind of explosive development
in the whole technology world""? LT: Not really. I mean, the big point for me, really,
was not when it was becoming huge, it was when it was becoming little. The big point for me was not being alone and having 10, maybe 100
people being involved -- that was a big point. Then everything else was very gradual. Going from 100 people to a million people
is not a big deal -- to me. Well, I mean, maybe it is if you're -- (Laughter) If you want to sell your result
then it's a huge deal -- don't get me wrong. But if you're interested in the technology and you're interested in the project, the big part was getting the community. Then the community grew gradually. And there's actually not
a single point where I went like, ""Wow, that just took off!"" because it -- I mean -- it took a long time, relatively. CA: So all the technologists
that I talk to really credit you with massively changing their work. And it's not just Linux, it's this thing called Git, which is this management system
for software development. Tell us briefly about that
and your role in that. LT: So one of the issues we had, and this took a while to start to appear, is when you ... When you grow from having 10 people
or 100 people working on a project to having 10,000 people, which -- I mean, right now we're in the situation
where just on the kernel, we have 1,000 people involved
in every single release and that's every two months,
roughly two or three months. Some of those people don't do a lot. There's a lot of people
who make small, small changes. But to maintain this, the scale changes how
you have to maintain it. And we went through a lot of pain. And there are whole projects
that do only source-code maintenance. CVS is the one that used to be
the most commonly used, and I hated CVS with a passion
and refused to touch it and tried something else
that was radical and interesting and everybody else hated. CA: (Laughs) LT: And we were in this bad spot, where we had thousands of people
who wanted to participate, but in many ways,
I was the kind of break point, where I could not scale to the point where I could work
with thousands of people. So Git is my second big project, which was only created for me
to maintain my first big project. And this is literally how I work. I don't code for -- well, I do code for fun -- but I want to code
for something meaningful so every single project I've ever done
has been something I needed and -- CA: So really, both Linux
and Git kind of arose almost as an unintended consequence of your desire not to have
to work with too many people. LT: Absolutely. Yes. (Laughter) CA: That's amazing.
LT: Yeah. (Applause) And yet, you're the man
who's transformed technology not just once but twice, and we have to try
and understand why it is. You've given us some clues, but ... Here's a picture of you as a kid,
with a Rubik's Cube. You mentioned that you've been
programming since you were like 10 or 11, half your life. Were you this sort of computer
genius, you know, übernerd, were you the star at school
who could do everything? What were you like as a kid? LT: Yeah, I think I was
the prototypical nerd. I mean, I was ... I was not a people person back then. That's my younger brother. I was clearly more interested
in the Rubik's Cube than my younger brother. (Laughter) My younger sister,
who's not in the picture, when we had family meetings -- and it's not a huge family, but I have,
like, a couple of cousins -- she would prep me beforehand. Like, before I stepped
into the room she would say, ""OK. That's so-and-so ..."" Because I was not -- I was a geek. I was into computers, I was into math, I was into physics. I was good at that. I don't think I was
particularly exceptional. Apparently, my sister said that my biggest exceptional quality
was that I would not let go. CA: OK, so let's go there,
because that's interesting. You would not let go. So that's not about being
a geek and being smart, that's about being ... stubborn? LT: That's about being stubborn. That's about, like, just starting something and not saying, ""OK, I'm done,
let's do something else -- Look: shiny!"" And I notice that in many
other parts in my life, too. I lived in Silicon Valley for seven years. And I worked for the same
company, in Silicon Valley, for the whole time. That is unheard of. That's not how Silicon Valley works. The whole point of Silicon Valley
is that people jump between jobs to kind of mix up the pot. And that's not the kind of person I am. CA: But during the actual
development of Linux itself, that stubbornness sometimes brought
you in conflict with other people. Talk about that a bit. Was that essential to sort of maintain
the quality of what was being built? How would you describe what happened? LT: I don't know if it's essential. Going back to the ""I'm not
a people person,"" -- sometimes I'm also ... shall we say, ""myopic"" when it comes
to other people's feelings, and that sometimes makes you
say things that hurt other people. And I'm not proud of that. (Applause) But, at the same time, it's -- I get people who tell me
that I should be nice. And then when I try to explain to them
that maybe you're nice, maybe you should be more aggressive, they see that as me being not nice. (Laughter) What I'm trying to say
is we are different. I'm not a people person; it's not something
I'm particularly proud of, but it's part of me. And one of the things
I really like about open source is it really allows different
people to work together. We don't have to like each other -- and sometimes we really
don't like each other. Really -- I mean, there are very,
very heated arguments. But you can, actually,
you can find things that -- you don't even agree to disagree, it's just that you're interested
in really different things. And coming back to the point
where I said earlier that I was afraid of commercial people
taking advantage of your work, it turned out, and very
quickly turned out, that those commercial people
were lovely, lovely people. And they did all the things that I was not
at all interested in doing, and they had completely different goals. And they used open source in ways
that I just did not want to go. But because it was open
source they could do it, and it actually works
really beautifully together. And I actually think
it works the same way. You need to have the people-people,
the communicators, the warm and friendly people who like -- (Laughter) really want to hug you
and get you into the community. But that's not everybody. And that's not me. I care about the technology. There are people who care about the UI. I can't do UI to save my life. I mean, if I was stranded on an island and the only way to get off that island
was the make a pretty UI, I'd die there. (Laughter) So there's different kinds of people, and I'm not making excuses,
I'm trying to explain. CA: Now, when we talked last week, you talked about some
other trait that you have, which I found really interesting. It's this idea called taste. And I've just got a couple of images here. I think this is an example of not
particularly good taste in code, and this one is better taste, which one can immediately see. What is the difference between these two? LT: So this is -- How many people here actually have coded? CA: Oh my goodness. LT: So I guarantee you, everybody who raised their hand, they have done what's called
a singly-linked list. And it's taught -- This, the first not very
good taste approach, is basically how it's taught to be done
when you start out coding. And you don't have to understand the code. The most interesting part to me is the last if statement. Because what happens
in a singly-linked list -- this is trying to remove
an existing entry from a list -- and there's a difference
between if it's the first entry or whether it's an entry in the middle. Because if it's the first entry, you have to change
the pointer to the first entry. If it's in the middle, you have to change the pointer
of a previous entry. So they're two completely different cases. CA: And that's better. LT: And this is better. It does not have the if statement. And it doesn't really matter -- I don't want you understand
why it doesn't have the if statement, but I want you to understand that sometimes you can see
a problem in a different way and rewrite it so that
a special case goes away and becomes the normal case. And that's good code. But this is simple code. This is CS 101. This is not important --
although, details are important. To me, the sign of people
I really want to work with is that they have good taste,
which is how ... I sent you this stupid example that is not relevant
because it's too small. Good taste is much bigger than this. Good taste is about really
seeing the big patterns and kind of instinctively knowing
what's the right way to do things. CA: OK, so we're putting
the pieces together here now. You have taste, in a way that's meaningful
to software people. You're -- (Laughter) LT: I think it was meaningful
to some people here. CA: You're a very smart computer coder, and you're hellish stubborn. But there must be something else. I mean, you've changed the future. You must have the ability
of these grand visions of the future. You're a visionary, right? LT: I've actually felt slightly
uncomfortable at TED for the last two days, because there's a lot
of vision going on, right? And I am not a visionary. I do not have a five-year plan. I'm an engineer. And I think it's really -- I mean -- I'm perfectly
happy with all the people who are walking around
and just staring at the clouds and looking at the stars
and saying, ""I want to go there."" But I'm looking at the ground, and I want to fix the pothole
that's right in front of me before I fall in. This is the kind of person I am. (Cheers) (Applause) CA: So you spoke to me last week
about these two guys. Who are they and how
do you relate to them? LT: Well, so this is kind
of cliché in technology, the whole Tesla versus Edison, where Tesla is seen as the visionary
scientist and crazy idea man. And people love Tesla. I mean, there are people who name
their companies after him. (Laughter) The other person there is Edison, who is actually often vilified
for being kind of pedestrian and is -- I mean, his most famous quote is, ""Genius is one percent inspiration
and 99 percent perspiration."" And I'm in the Edison camp, even if people don't always like him. Because if you actually compare the two, Tesla has kind of this mind
grab these days, but who actually changed the world? Edison may not have been a nice person, he did a lot of things -- he was maybe not so intellectual, not so visionary. But I think I'm more
of an Edison than a Tesla. CA: So our theme at TED
this week is dreams -- big, bold, audacious dreams. You're really the antidote to that. LT: I'm trying to dial it down a bit, yes. CA: That's good. (Laughter) We embrace you, we embrace you. Companies like Google and many
others have made, arguably, like, billions of dollars
out of your software. Does that piss you off? LT: No. No, it doesn't piss me off
for several reasons. And one of them is, I'm doing fine. I'm really doing fine. But the other reason is -- I mean, without doing the whole
open source and really letting go thing, Linux would never have been what it is. And it's brought experiences
I don't really enjoy, public talking, but at the same time,
this is an experience. Trust me. So there's a lot of things going on
that make me a very happy man and thinking I did the right choices. CA: Is the open source idea -- this is, I think we'll end here -- is the open source idea
fully realized now in the world, or is there more that it could go, are there more things that it could do? LT: So, I'm of two minds there. I think one reason open source
works so well in code is that at the end of the day, code tends to be somewhat black and white. There's often a fairly good way to decide, this is done correctly
and this is not done well. Code either works or it doesn't, which means that there's less
room for arguments. And we have arguments despite this, right? In many other areas -- I mean, people have talked about
open politics and things like that -- and it's really hard sometimes to say that, yes, you can apply the same
principles in some other areas just because the black and white
turns into not just gray, but different colors. So, obviously open source in science
is making a comeback. Science was there first. But then science ended up
being pretty closed, with very expensive journals
and some of that going on. And open source is making
a comeback in science, with things like arXiv and open journals. Wikipedia changed the world, too. So there are other examples, I'm sure there are more to come. CA: But you're not a visionary, and so it's not up to you to name them. LT: No. (Laughter) It's up to you guys to make them, right? CA: Exactly. Linus Torvalds, thank you for Linux,
thank you for the Internet, thank you for all those Android phones. Thank you for coming here to TED
and revealing so much of yourself. LT: Thank you. (Applause)",2016-05-03T16:28:30Z
The surprising habits of original thinkers,Adam Grant,11027822,267022,6096,"Visit http://TED.com to get our entire library of TED Talks, transcripts, translations, personalized talk recommendations and more.","Seven years ago, a student came to me
and asked me to invest in his company. He said, ""I'm working with three friends, and we're going to try to disrupt
an industry by selling stuff online."" And I said, ""OK, you guys spent
the whole summer on this, right?"" ""No, we all took internships
just in case it doesn't work out."" ""All right, but you're going to
go in full time once you graduate."" ""Not exactly. We've all
lined up backup jobs."" Six months go by, it's the day before the company launches, and there is still
not a functioning website. ""You guys realize,
the entire company is a website. That's literally all it is."" So I obviously declined to invest. And they ended up
naming the company Warby Parker. (Laughter) They sell glasses online. They were recently recognized
as the world's most innovative company and valued at over a billion dollars. And now? My wife handles our investments. Why was I so wrong? To find out, I've been studying people
that I come to call ""originals."" Originals are nonconformists, people who not only have new ideas but take action to champion them. They are people
who stand out and speak up. Originals drive creativity
and change in the world. They're the people you want to bet on. And they look nothing like I expected. I want to show you today
three things I've learned about recognizing originals and becoming a little bit more like them. So the first reason
that I passed on Warby Parker was they were really slow
getting off the ground. Now, you are all intimately familiar
with the mind of a procrastinator. Well, I have a confession for you.
I'm the opposite. I'm a precrastinator. Yes, that's an actual term. You know that panic you feel
a few hours before a big deadline when you haven't done anything yet. I just feel that
a few months ahead of time. (Laughter) So this started early: when I was a kid,
I took Nintendo games very seriously. I would wake up at 5am, start playing and not stop
until I had mastered them. Eventually it got so out of hand
that a local newspaper came and did a story on the dark side
of Nintendo, starring me. (Laughter) (Applause) Since then, I have traded hair for teeth. (Laughter) But this served me well in college, because I finished my senior thesis
four months before the deadline. And I was proud of that,
until a few years ago. I had a student named Jihae,
who came to me and said, ""I have my most creative ideas
when I'm procrastinating."" And I was like, ""That's cute,
where are the four papers you owe me?"" (Laughter) No, she was one
of our most creative students, and as an organizational psychologist,
this is the kind of idea that I test. So I challenged her to get some data. She goes into a bunch of companies. She has people fill out surveys
about how often they procrastinate. Then she gets their bosses to rate
how creative and innovative they are. And sure enough,
the precrastinators like me, who rush in and do everything early are rated as less creative than people who procrastinate moderately. So I want to know what happens
to the chronic procrastinators. She was like, ""I don't know.
They didn't fill out my survey."" (Laughter) No, here are our results. You actually do see that the people
who wait until the last minute are so busy goofing off
that they don't have any new ideas. And on the flip side,
the people who race in are in such a frenzy of anxiety that they
don't have original thoughts either. There's a sweet spot
where originals seem to live. Why is this? Maybe original people
just have bad work habits. Maybe procrastinating
does not cause creativity. To find out, we designed some experiments. We asked people
to generate new business ideas, and then we get independent readers to evaluate how creative
and useful they are. And some of them are asked
to do the task right away. Others we randomly assign
to procrastinate by dangling Minesweeper in front of them for either five or 10 minutes. And sure enough,
the moderate procrastinators are 16 percent more creative
than the other two groups. Now, Minesweeper is awesome,
but it's not the driver of the effect, because if you play the game first
before you learn about the task, there's no creativity boost. It's only when you're told that you're
going to be working on this problem, and then you start procrastinating, but the task is still active
in the back of your mind, that you start to incubate. Procrastination gives you time
to consider divergent ideas, to think in nonlinear ways,
to make unexpected leaps. So just as we were finishing
these experiments, I was starting to write
a book about originals, and I thought, ""This is the perfect time
to teach myself to procrastinate, while writing a chapter
on procrastination."" So I metaprocrastinated, and like any self-respecting
precrastinator, I woke up early the next morning and I made a to-do list
with steps on how to procrastinate. (Laughter) And then I worked diligently toward my goal of not making
progress toward my goal. I started writing
the procrastination chapter, and one day -- I was halfway through -- I literally put it away in mid-sentence for months. It was agony. But when I came back to it,
I had all sorts of new ideas. As Aaron Sorkin put it, ""You call it procrastinating.
I call it thinking."" And along the way I discovered that a lot of great originals
in history were procrastinators. Take Leonardo da Vinci. He toiled on and off for 16 years on the Mona Lisa. He felt like a failure. He wrote as much in his journal. But some of the diversions
he took in optics transformed the way that he modeled light and made him into a much better painter. What about Martin Luther King, Jr.? The night before
the biggest speech of his life, the March on Washington, he was up past 3am, rewriting it. He's sitting in the audience
waiting for his turn to go onstage, and he is still scribbling notes
and crossing out lines. When he gets onstage, 11 minutes in, he leaves his prepared remarks to utter four words
that changed the course of history: ""I have a dream."" That was not in the script. By delaying the task of finalizing
the speech until the very last minute, he left himself open
to the widest range of possible ideas. And because the text wasn't set in stone, he had freedom to improvise. Procrastinating is a vice
when it comes to productivity, but it can be a virtue for creativity. What you see with a lot of great originals is that they are quick to start
but they're slow to finish. And this is what I missed
with Warby Parker. When they were dragging
their heels for six months, I looked at them and said, ""You know, a lot of other companies
are starting to sell glasses online."" They missed the first-mover advantage. But what I didn't realize was
they were spending all that time trying to figure out how to get people to be comfortable ordering glasses online. And it turns out the first-mover
advantage is mostly a myth. Look at a classic study
of over 50 product categories, comparing the first movers
who created the market with the improvers who introduced
something different and better. What you see is that the first movers
had a failure rate of 47 percent, compared with only 8 percent
for the improvers. Look at Facebook,
waiting to build a social network until after Myspace and Friendster. Look at Google, waiting for years
after Altavista and Yahoo. It's much easier to improve
on somebody else's idea than it is to create
something new from scratch. So the lesson I learned is that
to be original you don't have to be first. You just have to be different and better. But that wasn't the only reason
I passed on Warby Parker. They were also full of doubts. They had backup plans lined up, and that made me doubt
that they had the courage to be original, because I expected that originals
would look something like this. (Laughter) Now, on the surface, a lot of original people look confident, but behind the scenes, they feel the same fear and doubt
that the rest of us do. They just manage it differently. Let me show you: this is a depiction of how the creative process
works for most of us. (Laughter) Now, in my research, I discovered
there are two different kinds of doubt. There's self-doubt and idea doubt. Self-doubt is paralyzing. It leads you to freeze. But idea doubt is energizing. It motivates you to test,
to experiment, to refine, just like MLK did. And so the key to being original is just a simple thing of avoiding the leap
from step three to step four. Instead of saying, ""I'm crap,"" you say, ""The first few drafts
are always crap, and I'm just not there yet."" So how do you get there? Well, there's a clue, it turns out, in the Internet browser that you use. We can predict your job performance
and your commitment just by knowing what web browser you use. Now, some of you are not
going to like the results of this study -- (Laughter) But there is good evidence
that Firefox and Chrome users significantly outperform
Internet Explorer and Safari users. Yes. (Applause) They also stay in their jobs
15 percent longer, by the way. Why? It's not a technical advantage. The four browser groups
on average have similar typing speed and they also have similar levels
of computer knowledge. It's about how you got the browser. Because if you use
Internet Explorer or Safari, those came preinstalled on your computer, and you accepted the default option
that was handed to you. If you wanted Firefox or Chrome,
you had to doubt the default and ask, is there
a different option out there, and then be a little resourceful
and download a new browser. So people hear about this study
and they're like, ""Great, if I want to get better at my job,
I just need to upgrade my browser?"" (Laughter) No, it's about being the kind of person who takes the initiative
to doubt the default and look for a better option. And if you do that well, you will open yourself up
to the opposite of déjà vu. There's a name for it.
It's called vuja de. (Laughter) Vuja de is when you look at something
you've seen many times before and all of a sudden
see it with fresh eyes. It's a screenwriter
who looks at a movie script that can't get the green light
for more than half a century. In every past version,
the main character has been an evil queen. But Jennifer Lee starts to question
whether that makes sense. She rewrites the first act, reinvents the villain as a tortured hero and Frozen becomes
the most successful animated movie ever. So there's a simple message
from this story. When you feel doubt, don't let it go. (Laughter) What about fear? Originals feel fear, too. They're afraid of failing, but what sets them apart
from the rest of us is that they're even more
afraid of failing to try. They know you can fail
by starting a business that goes bankrupt or by failing to start a business at all. They know that in the long run,
our biggest regrets are not our actions but our inactions. The things we wish we could redo,
if you look at the science, are the chances not taken. Elon Musk told me recently,
he didn't expect Tesla to succeed. He was sure the first few SpaceX launches would fail to make it to orbit,
let alone get back, but it was too important not to try. And for so many of us,
when we have an important idea, we don't bother to try. But I have some good news for you. You are not going to get judged
on your bad ideas. A lot of people think they will. If you look across industries and ask people about their biggest idea,
their most important suggestion, 85 percent of them stayed silent
instead of speaking up. They were afraid of embarrassing
themselves, of looking stupid. But guess what? Originals
have lots and lots of bad ideas, tons of them, in fact. Take the guy who invented this. Do you care that he came up
with a talking doll so creepy that it scared not only kids
but adults, too? No. You celebrate Thomas Edison
for pioneering the light bulb. (Laughter) If you look across fields, the greatest originals
are the ones who fail the most, because they're the ones who try the most. Take classical composers,
the best of the best. Why do some of them get more pages
in encyclopedias than others and also have their compositions
rerecorded more times? One of the best predictors is the sheer volume
of compositions that they generate. The more output you churn out,
the more variety you get and the better your chances
of stumbling on something truly original. Even the three icons of classical music --
Bach, Beethoven, Mozart -- had to generate hundreds
and hundreds of compositions to come up with a much smaller
number of masterpieces. Now, you may be wondering, how did this guy become great
without doing a whole lot? I don't know how Wagner pulled that off. But for most of us,
if we want to be more original, we have to generate more ideas. The Warby Parker founders, when they
were trying to name their company, they needed something sophisticated,
unique, with no negative associations to build a retail brand, and they tested over 2,000 possibilities before they finally put together Warby and Parker. So if you put all this together,
what you see is that originals are not that different
from the rest of us. They feel fear and doubt.
They procrastinate. They have bad ideas. And sometimes, it's not in spite
of those qualities but because of them that they succeed. So when you see those things,
don't make the same mistake I did. Don't write them off. And when that's you,
don't count yourself out either. Know that being quick to start
but slow to finish can boost your creativity, that you can motivate yourself
by doubting your ideas and embracing the fear of failing to try, and that you need a lot of bad ideas
in order to get a few good ones. Look, being original is not easy, but I have no doubt about this: it's the best way
to improve the world around us. Thank you. (Applause)",2016-04-26T15:28:18Z
Inside the Mind of a Master Procrastinator,Tim Urban,58400353,1997927,78954,"Tim Urban knows that procrastination doesn't make sense, but he's never been able to shake his habit of waiting until the last ...","So in college, I was a government major, which means I had to write
a lot of papers. Now, when a normal student writes a paper, they might spread the work out
a little like this. So, you know -- (Laughter) you get started maybe a little slowly, but you get enough done in the first week that, with some heavier days later on, everything gets done, things stay civil. (Laughter) And I would want to do that like that. That would be the plan. I would have it all ready to go, but then, actually, the paper
would come along, and then I would kind of do this. (Laughter) And that would happen every single paper. But then came my 90-page senior thesis, a paper you're supposed
to spend a year on. And I knew for a paper like that,
my normal work flow was not an option. It was way too big a project. So I planned things out, and I decided I kind of had
to go something like this. This is how the year would go. So I'd start off light, and I'd bump it up in the middle months, and then at the end,
I would kick it up into high gear just like a little staircase. How hard could it be
to walk up the stairs? No big deal, right? But then, the funniest thing happened. Those first few months? They came and went, and I couldn't quite do stuff. So we had an awesome new revised plan. (Laughter) And then -- (Laughter) But then those middle months
actually went by, and I didn't really write words, and so we were here. And then two months turned into one month, which turned into two weeks. And one day I woke up with three days until the deadline, still not having written a word, and so I did the only thing I could: I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours, pulling not one but two all-nighters -- humans are not supposed to pull
two all-nighters -- sprinted across campus, dove in slow motion, and got it in just at the deadline. I thought that was the end of everything. But a week later I get a call, and it's the school. And they say, ""Is this Tim Urban?"" And I say, ""Yeah."" And they say, ""We need
to talk about your thesis."" And I say, ""OK."" And they say, ""It's the best one we've ever seen."" (Laughter) (Applause) That did not happen. (Laughter) It was a very, very bad thesis. (Laughter) I just wanted to enjoy that one moment
when all of you thought, ""This guy is amazing!"" (Laughter) No, no, it was very, very bad. Anyway, today I'm a writer-blogger guy. I write the blog Wait But Why. And a couple of years ago,
I decided to write about procrastination. My behavior has always perplexed
the non-procrastinators around me, and I wanted to explain
to the non-procrastinators of the world what goes on in the heads
of procrastinators, and why we are the way we are. Now, I had a hypothesis that the brains of procrastinators
were actually different than the brains of other people. And to test this, I found an MRI lab that actually let me scan both my brain and the brain of a proven
non-procrastinator, so I could compare them. I actually brought them here
to show you today. I want you to take a look carefully
to see if you can notice a difference. I know that if you're not
a trained brain expert, it's not that obvious,
but just take a look, OK? So here's the brain
of a non-procrastinator. (Laughter) Now ... here's my brain. (Laughter) There is a difference. Both brains have a Rational
Decision-Maker in them, but the procrastinator's brain also has an Instant Gratification Monkey. Now, what does this mean
for the procrastinator? Well, it means everything's fine
until this happens. [This is a perfect time
to get some work done.] [Nope!] So the Rational Decision-Maker
will make the rational decision to do something productive, but the Monkey doesn't like that plan, so he actually takes the wheel, and he says, ""Actually, let's read
the entire Wikipedia page of the Nancy Kerrigan/
Tonya Harding scandal, because I just remembered
that that happened. (Laughter) Then -- (Laughter) Then we're going to go over to the fridge, to see if there's anything new
in there since 10 minutes ago. After that, we're going to go
on a YouTube spiral that starts with videos
of Richard Feynman talking about magnets and ends much, much later
with us watching interviews with Justin Bieber's mom. (Laughter) ""All of that's going to take a while, so we're not going to really have room
on the schedule for any work today. Sorry!"" (Sigh) Now, what is going on here? The Instant Gratification Monkey
does not seem like a guy you want behind the wheel. He lives entirely in the present moment. He has no memory of the past,
no knowledge of the future, and he only cares about two things: easy and fun. Now, in the animal world, that works fine. If you're a dog and you spend your whole life doing
nothing other than easy and fun things, you're a huge success! (Laughter) And to the Monkey, humans are just another animal species. You have to keep well-slept, well-fed
and propagating into the next generation, which in tribal times
might have worked OK. But, if you haven't noticed,
now we're not in tribal times. We're in an advanced civilization,
and the Monkey does not know what that is. Which is why we have
another guy in our brain, the Rational Decision-Maker, who gives us the ability to do things
no other animal can do. We can visualize the future. We can see the big picture. We can make long-term plans. And he wants to take
all of that into account. And he wants to just have us do whatever makes sense
to be doing right now. Now, sometimes it makes sense to be doing things that are easy and fun, like when you're having dinner
or going to bed or enjoying well-earned leisure time. That's why there's an overlap. Sometimes they agree. But other times, it makes much more sense to be doing things that are harder
and less pleasant, for the sake of the big picture. And that's when we have a conflict. And for the procrastinator, that conflict tends to end
a certain way every time, leaving him spending a lot of time
in this orange zone, an easy and fun place that's entirely
out of the Makes Sense circle. I call it the Dark Playground. (Laughter) Now, the Dark Playground is a place that all of you procrastinators
out there know very well. It's where leisure activities happen at times when leisure activities
are not supposed to be happening. The fun you have in the Dark Playground isn't actually fun,
because it's completely unearned, and the air is filled with guilt,
dread, anxiety, self-hatred -- all of those good procrastinator feelings. And the question is, in this situation,
with the Monkey behind the wheel, how does the procrastinator ever get
himself over here to this blue zone, a less pleasant place, but where
really important things happen? Well, turns out the procrastinator
has a guardian angel, someone who's always looking
down on him and watching over him in his darkest moments -- someone called the Panic Monster. (Laughter) Now, the Panic Monster
is dormant most of the time, but he suddenly wakes up
anytime a deadline gets too close or there's danger of public embarrassment, a career disaster or some other
scary consequence. And importantly, he's the only thing
the Monkey is terrified of. Now, he became very relevant
in my life pretty recently, because the people of TED
reached out to me about six months ago and invited me to do a TED Talk. (Laughter) Now, of course, I said yes. It's always been a dream of mine
to have done a TED Talk in the past. (Laughter) (Applause) But in the middle of all this excitement, the Rational Decision-Maker seemed
to have something else on his mind. He was saying, ""Are we clear
on what we just accepted? Do we get what's going to be now
happening one day in the future? We need to sit down
and work on this right now."" And the Monkey said, ""Totally agree,
but let's just open Google Earth and zoom in to the bottom of India,
like 200 feet above the ground, and scroll up for two and a half hours
til we get to the top of the country, so we can get a better feel for India."" (Laughter) So that's what we did that day. (Laughter) As six months turned into four
and then two and then one, the people of TED decided
to release the speakers. And I opened up the website,
and there was my face staring right back at me. And guess who woke up? (Laughter) So the Panic Monster
starts losing his mind, and a few seconds later,
the whole system's in mayhem. (Laughter) And the Monkey -- remember,
he's terrified of the Panic Monster -- boom, he's up the tree! And finally, finally, the Rational Decision-Maker
can take the wheel and I can start working on the talk. Now, the Panic Monster explains all kinds of pretty insane
procrastinator behavior, like how someone like me
could spend two weeks unable to start the opening
sentence of a paper, and then miraculously find
the unbelievable work ethic to stay up all night
and write eight pages. And this entire situation,
with the three characters -- this is the procrastinator's system. It's not pretty, but in the end, it works. This is what I decided to write about
on the blog a couple of years ago. When I did, I was amazed by the response. Literally thousands of emails came in, from all different kinds of people
from all over the world, doing all different kinds of things. These are people who were nurses,
bankers, painters, engineers and lots and lots of PhD students. (Laughter) And they were all writing,
saying the same thing: ""I have this problem too."" But what struck me was the contrast
between the light tone of the post and the heaviness of these emails. These people were writing
with intense frustration about what procrastination
had done to their lives, about what this Monkey had done to them. And I thought about this, and I said, well, if the procrastinator's system
works, then what's going on? Why are all of these people
in such a dark place? Well, it turns out that there's
two kinds of procrastination. Everything I've talked about today,
the examples I've given, they all have deadlines. And when there's deadlines, the effects of procrastination
are contained to the short term because the Panic Monster gets involved. But there's a second kind
of procrastination that happens in situations
when there is no deadline. So if you wanted a career
where you're a self-starter -- something in the arts,
something entrepreneurial -- there's no deadlines on those things
at first, because nothing's happening, not until you've gone out
and done the hard work to get momentum, get things going. There's also all kinds of important things
outside of your career that don't involve any deadlines, like seeing your family or exercising
and taking care of your health, working on your relationship or getting out of a relationship
that isn't working. Now if the procrastinator's only mechanism
of doing these hard things is the Panic Monster, that's a problem, because in all of these
non-deadline situations, the Panic Monster doesn't show up. He has nothing to wake up for, so the effects of procrastination,
they're not contained; they just extend outward forever. And it's this long-term
kind of procrastination that's much less visible
and much less talked about than the funnier, short-term
deadline-based kind. It's usually suffered
quietly and privately. And it can be the source of a huge amount of long-term
unhappiness, and regrets. And I thought, that's why
those people are emailing, and that's why they're
in such a bad place. It's not that they're cramming
for some project. It's that long-term procrastination
has made them feel like a spectator, at times, in their own lives. The frustration is not
that they couldn't achieve their dreams; it's that they weren't even
able to start chasing them. So I read these emails
and I had a little bit of an epiphany -- that I don't think
non-procrastinators exist. That's right -- I think all of you
are procrastinators. Now, you might not all be a mess, like some of us, (Laughter) and some of you may have
a healthy relationship with deadlines, but remember: the Monkey's sneakiest trick is when the deadlines aren't there. Now, I want to show you one last thing. I call this a Life Calendar. That's one box for every week
of a 90-year life. That's not that many boxes, especially since we've already
used a bunch of those. So I think we need to all take a long,
hard look at that calendar. We need to think about what
we're really procrastinating on, because everyone is procrastinating
on something in life. We need to stay aware
of the Instant Gratification Monkey. That's a job for all of us. And because there's not
that many boxes on there, it's a job that should
probably start today. Well, maybe not today, but ... (Laughter) You know. Sometime soon. Thank you. (Applause)",2016-04-06T16:59:35Z
10 ways to have a better conversation,Celeste Headlee,14837499,383522,5420,"When your job hinges on how well you talk to people, you learn a lot about how to have conversations -- and that most of us don't ...","All right, I want to see a show of hands: how many of you have
unfriended someone on Facebook because they said something offensive
about politics or religion, childcare, food? (Laughter) And how many of you
know at least one person that you avoid because you just don't want
to talk to them? (Laughter) You know, it used to be that in order
to have a polite conversation, we just had to follow the advice
of Henry Higgins in ""My Fair Lady"": Stick to the weather and your health. But these days, with climate change
and anti-vaxxing, those subjects -- (Laughter) are not safe either. So this world that we live in, this world in which every conversation has the potential
to devolve into an argument, where our politicians
can't speak to one another and where even the most trivial of issues have someone fighting both passionately
for it and against it, it's not normal. Pew Research did a study
of 10,000 American adults, and they found that at this moment,
we are more polarized, we are more divided, than we ever have been in history. We're less likely to compromise, which means we're
not listening to each other. And we make decisions about where to live, who to marry and even
who our friends are going to be, based on what we already believe. Again, that means
we're not listening to each other. A conversation requires a balance
between talking and listening, and somewhere along the way,
we lost that balance. Now, part of that is due to technology. The smartphones that you all
either have in your hands or close enough that you could
grab them really quickly. According to Pew Research, about a third of American teenagers
send more than a hundred texts a day. And many of them, almost most of them,
are more likely to text their friends than they are to talk
to them face to face. There's this great piece in The Atlantic. It was written by a high school teacher
named Paul Barnwell. And he gave his kids
a communication project. He wanted to teach them how to speak
on a specific subject without using notes. And he said this: “I came to realize...” (Laughter) ""I came to realize
that conversational competence might be the single
most overlooked skill we fail to teach. Kids spend hours each day engaging
with ideas and each other through screens, but rarely do they have an opportunity to hone their interpersonal
communications skills. It might sound like a funny question,
but we have to ask ourselves: Is there any 21st-century skill more important than being able to sustain
coherent, confident conversation?"" Now, I make my living talking to people: Nobel Prize winners, truck drivers, billionaires, kindergarten teachers, heads of state, plumbers. I talk to people that I like.
I talk to people that I don’t like. I talk to some people that I disagree with
deeply on a personal level. But I still have
a great conversation with them. So I'd like to spend the next 10 minutes
or so teaching you how to talk and how to listen. Many of you have already heard
a lot of advice on this, things like look the person in the eye, think of interesting topics
to discuss in advance, look, nod and smile to show
that you're paying attention, repeat back what you just heard
or summarize it. So I want you to forget all of that. It is crap. (Laughter) There is no reason to learn
how to show you're paying attention if you are in fact paying attention. (Laughter) (Applause) Now, I actually use the exact
same skills as a professional interviewer that I do in regular life. So, I'm going to teach you
how to interview people, and that's actually going to help you
learn how to be better conversationalists. Learn to have a conversation without wasting your time,
without getting bored, and, please God,
without offending anybody. We've all had really great conversations. We've had them before.
We know what it's like. The kind of conversation where you
walk away feeling engaged and inspired, or where you feel
like you've made a real connection or you've been perfectly understood. There is no reason why most of your interactions
can't be like that. So I have 10 basic rules.
I'm going to walk you through all of them, but honestly, if you just choose
one of them and master it, you'll already enjoy better conversations. Number one: Don't multitask. And I don't mean
just set down your cell phone or your tablet or your car keys
or whatever is in your hand. I mean, be present. Be in that moment. Don't think about your argument
you had with your boss. Don't think about what
you're going to have for dinner. If you want to get out
of the conversation, get out of the conversation, but don't be half in it
and half out of it. Number two: Don't pontificate. If you want to state your opinion without any opportunity for response
or argument or pushback or growth, write a blog. (Laughter) Now, there's a really good reason
why I don't allow pundits on my show: Because they're really boring. If they're conservative, they're going to
hate Obama and food stamps and abortion. If they're liberal, they're going to hate big banks and oil corporations
and Dick Cheney. Totally predictable. And you don't want to be like that. You need to enter every conversation
assuming that you have something to learn. The famed therapist M. Scott Peck said that true listening requires
a setting aside of oneself. And sometimes that means
setting aside your personal opinion. He said that sensing this acceptance, the speaker will become
less and less vulnerable and more and more likely
to open up the inner recesses of his or her mind to the listener. Again, assume that you have
something to learn. Bill Nye: ""Everyone you will ever meet
knows something that you don't."" I put it this way: Everybody is an expert in something. Number three: Use open-ended questions. In this case, take a cue from journalists. Start your questions with who,
what, when, where, why or how. If you put in a complicated question,
you're going to get a simple answer out. If I ask you, ""Were you terrified?"" you're going to respond to the most
powerful word in that sentence, which is ""terrified,"" and the answer is
""Yes, I was"" or ""No, I wasn't."" ""Were you angry?"" ""Yes, I was very angry."" Let them describe it.
They're the ones that know. Try asking them things like,
""What was that like?"" ""How did that feel?"" Because then they might have to stop
for a moment and think about it, and you're going to get
a much more interesting response. Number four: Go with the flow. That means thoughts
will come into your mind and you need to let them
go out of your mind. We've heard interviews often in which a guest is talking
for several minutes and then the host comes back in
and asks a question which seems like it comes out of nowhere,
or it's already been answered. That means the host probably
stopped listening two minutes ago because he thought
of this really clever question, and he was just bound
and determined to say that. And we do the exact same thing. We're sitting there having
a conversation with someone, and then we remember that time
that we met Hugh Jackman in a coffee shop. (Laughter) And we stop listening. Stories and ideas
are going to come to you. You need to let them come and let them go. Number five: If you don't know,
say that you don't know. Now, people on the radio,
especially on NPR, are much more aware
that they're going on the record, and so they're more careful
about what they claim to be an expert in and what they claim to know for sure. Do that. Err on the side of caution. Talk should not be cheap. Number six: Don't equate
your experience with theirs. If they're talking
about having lost a family member, don't start talking about the time
you lost a family member. If they're talking about the trouble
they're having at work, don't tell them about
how much you hate your job. It's not the same. It is never the same. All experiences are individual. And, more importantly,
it is not about you. You don't need to take that moment
to prove how amazing you are or how much you've suffered. Somebody asked Stephen Hawking once
what his IQ was, and he said, ""I have no idea. People who brag
about their IQs are losers."" (Laughter) Conversations are not
a promotional opportunity. Number seven: Try not to repeat yourself. It's condescending,
and it's really boring, and we tend to do it a lot. Especially in work conversations
or in conversations with our kids, we have a point to make, so we just keep rephrasing it
over and over. Don't do that. Number eight: Stay out of the weeds. Frankly, people don't care about the years, the names, the dates, all those details that you're struggling
to come up with in your mind. They don't care.
What they care about is you. They care about what you're like, what you have in common. So forget the details. Leave them out. Number nine: This is not the last one,
but it is the most important one. Listen. I cannot tell you how many
really important people have said that listening is perhaps the most,
the number one most important skill that you could develop. Buddha said, and I'm paraphrasing, ""If your mouth is open,
you're not learning."" And Calvin Coolidge said, ""No man
ever listened his way out of a job."" (Laughter) Why do we not listen to each other? Number one, we'd rather talk. When I'm talking, I'm in control. I don't have to hear anything
I'm not interested in. I'm the center of attention. I can bolster my own identity. But there's another reason: We get distracted. The average person talks
at about 225 word per minute, but we can listen at up to
500 words per minute. So our minds are filling in
those other 275 words. And look, I know,
it takes effort and energy to actually pay attention to someone, but if you can't do that,
you're not in a conversation. You're just two people shouting out
barely related sentences in the same place. (Laughter) You have to listen to one another. Stephen Covey said it very beautifully. He said, ""Most of us don't listen
with the intent to understand. We listen with the intent to reply."" One more rule, number 10,
and it’s this one: Be brief. Be interested in other people. You know, I grew up
with a very famous grandfather, and there was kind of a ritual 
in my home. People would come over
to talk to my grandparents, and after they would leave,
my mother would come over to us, and she’d say, 
“Do you know who that was? She was the runner-up to Miss America. He was the mayor of Sacramento. She won a Pulitzer Prize.
He's a Russian ballet dancer."" And I kind of grew up assuming everyone has some hidden,
amazing thing about them. And honestly, I think
it's what makes me a better host. I keep my mouth shut
as often as I possibly can. I keep my mind open. And I’m always prepared to be amazed, and I'm never disappointed. You do the same thing. Go out, talk to people, listen to people, and, most importantly,
be prepared to be amazed. Thanks. (Applause)",2016-03-08T16:14:54Z
A simple way to break a bad habit,Judson Brewer,13246002,265301,4804,"Visit http://TED.com to get our entire library of TED Talks, transcripts, translations, personalized Talk recommendations and more.","When I was first learning to meditate, the instruction was to simply
pay attention to my breath, and when my mind wandered,
to bring it back. Sounded simple enough. Yet I'd sit on these silent retreats, sweating through T-shirts
in the middle of winter. I'd take naps every chance I got
because it was really hard work. Actually, it was exhausting. The instruction was simple enough but I was missing something
really important. So why is it so hard to pay attention? Well, studies show that even when we're really
trying to pay attention to something -- like maybe this talk -- at some point, about half of us
will drift off into a daydream, or have this urge
to check our Twitter feed. So what's going on here? It turns out that we're fighting one
of the most evolutionarily-conserved learning processes
currently known in science, one that's conserved back to the most basic
nervous systems known to man. This reward-based learning process is called positive
and negative reinforcement, and basically goes like this. We see some food that looks good, our brain says, ""Calories! ... Survival!"" We eat the food, we taste it -- it tastes good. And especially with sugar, our bodies send a signal
to our brain that says, ""Remember what you're eating
and where you found it."" We lay down this context-dependent memory and learn to repeat the process next time. See food, eat food, feel good, repeat. Trigger, behavior, reward. Simple, right? Well, after a while,
our creative brains say, ""You know what? You can use this for more
than just remembering where food is. You know, next time you feel bad, why don't you try eating
something good so you'll feel better?"" We thank our brains for the great idea, try this and quickly learn that if we eat chocolate or ice cream
when we're mad or sad, we feel better. Same process, just a different trigger. Instead of this hunger signal
coming from our stomach, this emotional signal -- feeling sad -- triggers that urge to eat. Maybe in our teenage years, we were a nerd at school, and we see those rebel kids
outside smoking and we think, ""Hey, I want to be cool."" So we start smoking. The Marlboro Man wasn't a dork,
and that was no accident. See cool, smoke to be cool, feel good. Repeat. Trigger, behavior, reward. And each time we do this, we learn to repeat the process and it becomes a habit. So later, feeling stressed out triggers
that urge to smoke a cigarette or to eat something sweet. Now, with these same brain processes, we've gone from learning to survive to literally killing ourselves
with these habits. Obesity and smoking are among the leading preventable causes
of morbidity and mortality in the world. So back to my breath. What if instead of fighting our brains, or trying to force ourselves
to pay attention, we instead tapped into this natural,
reward-based learning process ... but added a twist? What if instead we just got really curious about what was happening
in our momentary experience? I'll give you an example. In my lab, we studied whether mindfulness training
could help people quit smoking. Now, just like trying to force myself
to pay attention to my breath, they could try to force
themselves to quit smoking. And the majority of them
had tried this before and failed -- on average, six times. Now, with mindfulness training, we dropped the bit about forcing
and instead focused on being curious. In fact, we even told them to smoke. What? Yeah, we said, ""Go ahead and smoke, just be really curious
about what it's like when you do."" And what did they notice? Well here's an example
from one of our smokers. She said, ""Mindful smoking: smells like stinky cheese and tastes like chemicals, YUCK!"" Now, she knew, cognitively
that smoking was bad for her, that's why she joined our program. What she discovered just by being
curiously aware when she smoked was that smoking tastes like shit. (Laughter) Now, she moved from knowledge to wisdom. She moved from knowing in her head
that smoking was bad for her to knowing it in her bones, and the spell of smoking was broken. She started to become
disenchanted with her behavior. Now, the prefrontal cortex, that youngest part of our brain
from an evolutionary perspective, it understands on an intellectual level
that we shouldn't smoke. And it tries its hardest
to help us change our behavior, to help us stop smoking, to help us stop eating that second,
that third, that fourth cookie. We call this cognitive control. We're using cognition
to control our behavior. Unfortunately, this is also the first part of our brain that goes offline
when we get stressed out, which isn't that helpful. Now, we can all relate to this
in our own experience. We're much more likely to do things
like yell at our spouse or kids when we're stressed out or tired, even though we know
it's not going to be helpful. We just can't help ourselves. When the prefrontal cortex goes offline, we fall back into our old habits, which is why this disenchantment
is so important. Seeing what we get from our habits helps us understand them
at a deeper level -- to know it in our bones so we don't have to force
ourselves to hold back or restrain ourselves from behavior. We're just less interested
in doing it in the first place. And this is what mindfulness is all about: Seeing really clearly what we get
when we get caught up in our behaviors, becoming disenchanted on a visceral level and from this disenchanted stance,
naturally letting go. This isn't to say that, poof,
magically we quit smoking. But over time, as we learn
to see more and more clearly the results of our actions, we let go of old habits and form new ones. The paradox here is that mindfulness is just
about being really interested in getting close and personal with what's actually happening
in our bodies and minds from moment to moment. This willingness
to turn toward our experience rather than trying to make unpleasant
cravings go away as quickly as possible. And this willingness
to turn toward our experience is supported by curiosity, which is naturally rewarding. What does curiosity feel like? It feels good. And what happens when we get curious? We start to notice that cravings
are simply made up of body sensations -- oh, there's tightness, there's tension, there's restlessness -- and that these body
sensations come and go. These are bite-size pieces of experiences that we can manage from moment to moment rather than getting clobbered
by this huge, scary craving that we choke on. In other words, when we get curious, we step out of our old,
fear-based, reactive habit patterns, and we step into being. We become this inner scientist where we're eagerly awaiting
that next data point. Now, this might sound
too simplistic to affect behavior. But in one study,
we found that mindfulness training was twice as good as gold standard therapy
at helping people quit smoking. So it actually works. And when we studied
the brains of experienced meditators, we found that parts of a neural network
of self-referential processing called the default mode network were at play. Now, one current hypothesis
is that a region of this network, called the posterior cingulate cortex, is activated not necessarily
by craving itself but when we get caught up in it,
when we get sucked in, and it takes us for a ride. In contrast, when we let go -- step out of the process just by being curiously aware
of what's happening -- this same brain region quiets down. Now we're testing app and online-based
mindfulness training programs that target these core mechanisms and, ironically, use the same technology
that's driving us to distraction to help us step out
of our unhealthy habit patterns of smoking, of stress eating
and other addictive behaviors. Now, remember that bit
about context-dependent memory? We can deliver these tools
to peoples' fingertips in the contexts that matter most. So we can help them tap into their inherent capacity
to be curiously aware right when that urge to smoke
or stress eat or whatever arises. So if you don't smoke or stress eat, maybe the next time you feel this urge
to check your email when you're bored, or you're trying to distract
yourself from work, or maybe to compulsively respond
to that text message when you're driving, see if you can tap into
this natural capacity, just be curiously aware of what's happening in your body
and mind in that moment. It will just be another chance to perpetuate one of our endless
and exhaustive habit loops ... or step out of it. Instead of see text message,
compulsively text back, feel a little bit better -- notice the urge, get curious, feel the joy of letting go and repeat. Thank you. (Applause)",2016-02-24T17:53:22Z
What makes a good life? Lessons from the longest study on happiness,Robert Waldinger,27090911,519361,11746,"What keeps us happy and healthy as we go through life? If you think it's fame and money, you're not alone – but, according to ...","What keeps us healthy and happy as we go through life? If you were going to invest now in your future best self, where would you put your time
and your energy? There was a recent survey of millennials asking them what their
most important life goals were, and over 80 percent said that a major life goal for them
was to get rich. And another 50 percent
of those same young adults said that another major life goal was to become famous. (Laughter) And we're constantly told
to lean in to work, to push harder and achieve more. We're given the impression that these
are the things that we need to go after in order to have a good life. Pictures of entire lives, of the choices that people make
and how those choices work out for them, those pictures
are almost impossible to get. Most of what we know about human life we know from asking people
to remember the past, and as we know, hindsight
is anything but 20/20. We forget vast amounts
of what happens to us in life, and sometimes memory
is downright creative. But what if we could watch entire lives as they unfold through time? What if we could study people
from the time that they were teenagers all the way into old age to see what really keeps people
happy and healthy? We did that. The Harvard Study of Adult Development may be the longest study
of adult life that's ever been done. For 75 years, we've tracked
the lives of 724 men, year after year, asking about their work,
their home lives, their health, and of course asking all along the way
without knowing how their life stories were going to turn out. Studies like this are exceedingly rare. Almost all projects of this kind
fall apart within a decade because too many people
drop out of the study, or funding for the research dries up, or the researchers get distracted, or they die, and nobody moves the ball
further down the field. But through a combination of luck and the persistence
of several generations of researchers, this study has survived. About 60 of our original 724 men are still alive, still participating in the study, most of them in their 90s. And we are now beginning to study the more than 2,000 children of these men. And I'm the fourth director of the study. Since 1938, we've tracked the lives
of two groups of men. The first group started in the study when they were sophomores
at Harvard College. They all finished college
during World War II, and then most went off
to serve in the war. And the second group that we've followed was a group of boys
from Boston's poorest neighborhoods, boys who were chosen for the study specifically because they were
from some of the most troubled and disadvantaged families in the Boston of the 1930s. Most lived in tenements,
many without hot and cold running water. When they entered the study, all of these teenagers were interviewed. They were given medical exams. We went to their homes
and we interviewed their parents. And then these teenagers
grew up into adults who entered all walks of life. They became factory workers and lawyers
and bricklayers and doctors, one President of the United States. Some developed alcoholism.
A few developed schizophrenia. Some climbed the social ladder from the bottom
all the way to the very top, and some made that journey
in the opposite direction. The founders of this study would never in their wildest dreams have imagined that I would be
standing here today, 75 years later, telling you that
the study still continues. Every two years, our patient
and dedicated research staff calls up our men
and asks them if we can send them yet one more set of questions
about their lives. Many of the inner city Boston men ask us, ""Why do you keep wanting to study me?
My life just isn't that interesting."" The Harvard men never ask that question. (Laughter) To get the clearest picture
of these lives, we don't just send them questionnaires. We interview them in their living rooms. We get their medical records
from their doctors. We draw their blood, we scan their brains, we talk to their children. We videotape them talking with their wives
about their deepest concerns. And when, about a decade ago,
we finally asked the wives if they would join us
as members of the study, many of the women said,
""You know, it's about time."" (Laughter) So what have we learned? What are the lessons that come
from the tens of thousands of pages of information that we've generated on these lives? Well, the lessons aren't about wealth
or fame or working harder and harder. The clearest message that we get
from this 75-year study is this: Good relationships keep us
happier and healthier. Period. We've learned three big lessons
about relationships. The first is that social connections
are really good for us, and that loneliness kills. It turns out that people
who are more socially connected to family, to friends, to community, are happier, they're physically healthier,
and they live longer than people who are less well connected. And the experience of loneliness
turns out to be toxic. People who are more isolated
than they want to be from others find that they are less happy, their health declines earlier in midlife, their brain functioning declines sooner and they live shorter lives
than people who are not lonely. And the sad fact
is that at any given time, more than one in five Americans
will report that they're lonely. And we know that you
can be lonely in a crowd and you can be lonely in a marriage, so the second big lesson that we learned is that it's not just
the number of friends you have, and it's not whether or not
you're in a committed relationship, but it's the quality
of your close relationships that matters. It turns out that living in the midst
of conflict is really bad for our health. High-conflict marriages, for example,
without much affection, turn out to be very bad for our health,
perhaps worse than getting divorced. And living in the midst of good,
warm relationships is protective. Once we had followed our men
all the way into their 80s, we wanted to look back at them at midlife and to see if we could predict who was going to grow
into a happy, healthy octogenarian and who wasn't. And when we gathered together
everything we knew about them at age 50, it wasn't their middle age
cholesterol levels that predicted how they
were going to grow old. It was how satisfied they were
in their relationships. The people who were the most satisfied
in their relationships at age 50 were the healthiest at age 80. And good, close relationships
seem to buffer us from some of the slings and arrows
of getting old. Our most happily partnered men and women reported, in their 80s, that on the days
when they had more physical pain, their mood stayed just as happy. But the people who were
in unhappy relationships, on the days when they
reported more physical pain, it was magnified by more emotional pain. And the third big lesson that we learned
about relationships and our health is that good relationships
don't just protect our bodies, they protect our brains. It turns out that being
in a securely attached relationship to another person in your 80s
is protective, that the people who are in relationships where they really feel they can count
on the other person in times of need, those people's memories
stay sharper longer. And the people in relationships where they feel they really
can't count on the other one, those are the people who experience
earlier memory decline. And those good relationships,
they don't have to be smooth all the time. Some of our octogenarian couples
could bicker with each other day in and day out, but as long as they felt that they
could really count on the other when the going got tough, those arguments didn't take a toll
on their memories. So this message, that good, close relationships
are good for our health and well-being, this is wisdom that's as old as the hills. Why is this so hard to get
and so easy to ignore? Well, we're human. What we'd really like is a quick fix, something we can get that'll make our lives good
and keep them that way. Relationships are messy
and they're complicated and the hard work of tending
to family and friends, it's not sexy or glamorous. It's also lifelong. It never ends. The people in our 75-year study
who were the happiest in retirement were the people who had actively worked
to replace workmates with new playmates. Just like the millennials
in that recent survey, many of our men when they
were starting out as young adults really believed that fame and wealth
and high achievement were what they needed to go after
to have a good life. But over and over, over these 75 years,
our study has shown that the people who fared the best were
the people who leaned in to relationships, with family, with friends, with community. So what about you? Let's say you're 25,
or you're 40, or you're 60. What might leaning in
to relationships even look like? Well, the possibilities
are practically endless. It might be something as simple
as replacing screen time with people time or livening up a stale relationship
by doing something new together, long walks or date nights, or reaching out to that family member
who you haven't spoken to in years, because those all-too-common family feuds take a terrible toll on the people who hold the grudges. I'd like to close with a quote
from Mark Twain. More than a century ago, he was looking back on his life, and he wrote this: ""There isn't time, so brief is life, for bickerings, apologies,
heartburnings, callings to account. There is only time for loving, and but an instant,
so to speak, for that."" The good life is built
with good relationships. Thank you. (Applause)",2016-01-25T16:41:53Z
